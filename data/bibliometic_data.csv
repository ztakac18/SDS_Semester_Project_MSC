Recent developments in machine learning have brought significant opportunities to incorporate prediction theory into portfolio selection. However, many studies show that a single prediction model is insufficient to achieve very accurate predictions and affluent returns. In this paper, a novel portfolio construction approach is developed using a hybrid model based on machine learning for stock prediction and mean–variance (MV) model for portfolio selection. Specifically, two stages are involved in this model: stock prediction and portfolio selection. In the first stage, a hybrid model combining eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) with an improved firefly algorithm (IFA) is proposed to predict stock prices for the next period. The IFA is developed to optimize the hyperparameters of the XGBoost. In the second stage, stocks with higher potential returns are selected, and the MV model is employed for portfolio selection. Using the Shanghai Stock Exchange as the study sample, the obtained results demonstrate that the proposed method is superior to traditional ways (without stock prediction) and benchmarks in terms of returns and risks. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","eXtreme Gradient Boosting; Firefly algorithm; Mean–variance model; Portfolio selection; Stock prediction","Financial data processing; Financial markets; Forecasting; Machine learning; Optimization; Predictive analytics; Accurate prediction; Construction approaches; Firefly algorithms; Future performance; Portfolio optimization; Portfolio selection; Shanghai stock exchanges; Stock price prediction; Fintech",,,,,"Project of High-level Teachers in Beijing Municipal Universities in the Period of 13th Five-year Plan: CIT&TCD20190338

Most of the existing studies utilize only the datasets of target companies, and some studies use datasets of the relevant companies in the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) sectors. However, we show that GICS has a limitation in finding relevance regarding stock prediction because heterogeneity exists in the GICS sectors. To solve this limitation, we suggest a methodology that reflects heterogeneity and searches for homogeneous groups of companies which have high relevance. Stock price movements are predicted using the K-means clustering and multiple kernel learning technique which integrates information from the target company and its homogeneous cluster. We experiment using three-year data from the Republic of Korea and compare the results of the proposed method with those of existing methods. The results show that the proposed method shows higher predictability than existing methods in the majority of cases. The results also imply that the necessity of cluster analysis depends on the heterogeneity in the sector, and it is essential to perform cluster analysis with a larger number of clusters as the heterogeneity increases. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Cluster analysis; Data mining; Heterogeneity; Machine learning; Stock prediction","Classification (of information); Cluster analysis; Forecasting; K-means clustering; Learning systems; Homogeneous cluster; Homogeneous group; Machine learning technology; Multiple Kernel Learning; Number of clusters; Republic of Korea; Stock predictions; Stock price movements; Motion estimation",,,,,,,"Aiolli, F., Donini, M., EasyMKL: A scalable multiple kernel learning algorithm (2015) Neurocomputing, 169, pp. 215-224; Arthur, D., Vassilvitskii, S., (2007), k-means++: The advantages of careful seeding.

Researchers have designed various algorithms to accurately predict stock prices. This paper is focused on comparing the following three machine learning models applied to predict the stock price—Linear Regression model, Support Vector Regression (SVR) model, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. Conversational systems provide the ease of interacting with the computers in natural language. This paper also attempts to integrate the natural language interaction in the conversational systems with the forecasting abilities of machine learning model. To achieve the said integration, a conversational system has been developed with the ability to understand the intent of the queries in natural language, achieve relevant prediction using the machine learning model, and provide the retrieved information back in natural language. The developed conversational system is capable of answering questions related to stock price forecasting and suggestions related to buy/sell a stock. The results observed on comparing the three machine learning models provide an insight into understanding the tradeoffs between training time, accuracies, and trend prediction. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Chatbot; Forecasting; LSTM; Natural language processing; NLU; Rasa; RNN; Stock prediction; Support vector regression; Time-series analysis","Financial markets; Forecasting; Information management; Machine learning; Support vector regression; Conversational systems; Forecasting ability; Forecasting stock prices; Linear regression models; Machine learning models; Natural language interaction; Stock price forecasting; Support vector regression (SVR); Long short-term memory",,,,,,"The authors would like to place on record their sincere thanks to Mr. Joy Mustafi, for his valuable support and guidance.","Bocklisch, T., Faulkner, J., Pawlowski, N., Nichol, A., (2017) Rasa: open source language understanding and dialogue management, , arXiv preprint arXiv:1712.05181; Guresen, E., Kayakutlu, G., Daim, T.U., Using artificial neural network models in stock market index prediction (2011) Expert Syst.

The efficacious estimation of the company’s stock price may yield fruitful results for the company in term of their increased turnover. The efficient-market hypothesis advocates that current price of the stock market be a sign of all presently accessible information and a little change in the stock market price are not based on not only the newly revealed information thus are inherently unpredictable and irregular. Others deviate and those with this viewpoint possess myriad models, methods and expertise which purportedly permit them to estimate future price information. Machine Learning methods such as Support Vector Regression (SVR), Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and other models may be thought of as mathematical function approximators. The most familiar form of ANN for stock market prediction is the feed forward network employs the backward propagation of the errors algorithm to update the network weights.

It is a very complex and challenging system, where people invest to gain money in order to attain higher gains. But the scenario may be negative if the investment is made in the stocks without any proper analysis. The performance of any stock depends on many parameters and factors like historical prices, social media data, news, country economics, production of the company, etc. In our research, we consider two major factors like historical prices and social media data and will let the investors give an idea about the stock performance in the nearby future. Therefore, we combine the sentiments of the different stakeholders across the Internet with historic prices of the stock to predict the stock recital. For combining the above approaches, we are using the decision tree approach of machine learning for classification and prediction for more accurate prophecy.

Historically, stock market movements have been highly unpredictable as there are many factors that affect it. Immense research about financial history, as well as the current trends, must be done before thinking of investing in a particular company. For the prospective buyer to get a better sense of future, predictive models of machine learning can be used to predict whether the stocks will go high or low and how much. While no one can say with certainty that a stock will go up in value, taking the time to evaluate the past few years of the company’s growth can give some insight into the possibility. Employing traditional methods like fundamental and technical analysis may not ensure the reliability of the prediction. In this paper, we attempt to take financial historic data for the stock and try to get more detailed insights and derive parameters that we will use to predict the stock behavior. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Data analytics; Data science; Future prediction of stock; Statistical analysis; Stock analysis; Stock prediction","Commerce; Data Analytics; Financial markets; Forecasting; Intelligent systems; Predictive analytics; Reliability analysis; Financial system; Historic data; Predictive models; Prospective buyers; Stock market analysis; Technical analysis; Data communication systems",,,,,,,"Khan, W., Malik, U., Ghazanfar, M.A., Predicting stock market trends using machine learning algorithms via public sentiment and political situation analysis (2019) Soft Comput; Li, X., Wang, C., Dong, J., Wang, F., Deng, X., Zhu, S., Improving stock market prediction by integrating both market news and stock Prices (2011) Database and Expert Systems Applications.

The size of the trained DL model is large for these complex tasks, which makes it difficult to deploy on resource-constrained devices. For instance, size of the pre-trained VGG16 model trained on the ImageNet dataset is more than 500 MB. Resource-constrained devices such as mobile phones and internet of things devices have limited memory and less computation power. For real-time applications, the trained models should be deployed on resource-constrained devices. Popular convolutional neural network models have millions of parameters that leads to increase in the size of the trained model. Hence, it becomes essential to compress and accelerate these models before deploying on resource-constrained devices while making the least compromise with the model accuracy. It is a challenging task to retain the same accuracy after compressing the model. To address this challenge, in the last couple of years many researchers have suggested different techniques for model compression and acceleration. In this paper, we have presented a survey of various techniques suggested for compressing and accelerating the ML and DL models. We have also discussed the challenges of the existing techniques and have provided future research directions in the field. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","CNN; Deep learning; Efficient neural networks; Machine learning; Model compression and acceleration; Resource-constrained devices; RNN","Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Learning algorithms; Natural language processing systems; Surveys; Audio processing; Computation power; Future research directions; Model compression; NAtural language processing; Real-time application; Resourceconstrained devices; Stock predictions; Learning systems",,,,,,,"Agarwal, A., Xie, B., Vovsha, I., Rambow, O., Passonneau, R., Sentiment analysis of twitter data (2011) Proceedings of the Workshop on Language in Social Media (LSM 2011), pp. 30-38; Al-Rfou, R., Alain, G., Almahairi, A., Angermueller, C., Bahdanau, D., Ballas, N., Bastien, F., Belopolsky, A., (2016) Theano: A python framework for fast computation of mathematical expressions, , ArXiv preprint arXiv; Alvarez, J.M., Salzmann, M., Compression-aware training of deep networks (2017) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 856-867; Anwar, S., Hwang, K., Sung, W., Structured pruning of deep convolutional neural networks (2017) ACM J Emerg Technol Comput Syst (JETC), 13 (3), p. 32; Ardakani, A., Condo, C., Gross, W.J., (2016) Sparsely-connected neural networks: Towards efficient vlsi implementation of deep neural networks, , In: Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2017; Ardakani, A., Ji, Z., Smithson, S.C., Meyer, B.H., Gross, W.J., Learning recurrent binary/ternary weights (2019) International Conference on Learning Representations, , https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkNGYjR9FX; Babaeizadeh, M., Smaragdis, P., Campbell, R.H., A simple yet effective method to prune dense layers of neural networks (2017) Under Review as a Conference Paper at ICLR; Ba, J., Caruana, R., (2014) Do Deep Nets Really Need to Be Deep?

Machine learning methods have been widely used in financial time series prediction in recent years. How to label financial time series data to determine the prediction accuracy of machine learning models and subsequently determine final investment returns is a hot topic. Existing labeling methods of financial time series mainly label data by comparing the current data with those of a short time period in the future. However, financial time series data are typically non-linear with obvious short-term randomness. Therefore, these labeling methods have not captured the continuous trend features of financial time series data, leading to a difference between their labeling results and real market trends. In this paper, a new labeling method called “continuous trend labeling” is proposed to address the above problem. In the feature preprocessing stage, this paper proposed a new method that can avoid the problem of look-ahead bias in traditional data standardization or normalization processes. Then, a detailed logical explanation given, a definition of continuous trend labeling was proposed and also an automatic labeling algorithm was given to extract the continuous trend features of financial time series data. Experiments on the Shanghai Composite Index and Shenzhen Component Index and some stocks of China showed that our labeling method is a much better state-of-the-art labeling method in terms of classification accuracy and some other classification evaluation metrics. The results of the paper also proved that deep learning models such as LSTM and GRU are more suitable for dealing with the prediction of financial time series data. © 2020 by the authors.

Over the years, scholars have made unremitting efforts in forecasting the stock market. Because the more accurate the prediction, the more people will profit from the stock market. Machine learning has achieved excellent results in stock prediction. Nowadays, with the rise of deep learning, the stock prediction methods used by people are beginning to lean towards deep learning, and many results have been achieved. This paper will use news rather than traditional stock structured data for stock prediction, and we will use machine learning and deep learning methods in contrast. Moreover, we use natural language processing to process the news. The objects of prediction are stock indexes (DJIA, S & P500) and individual stocks (IBM, JPM). We find that deep learning performs at least 4.5% better than machine learning on prediction tasks related to stock indexes, and at least 3% better in the prediction of individual stocks. We discuss the implications of this result. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Commerce; Financial markets; Forecasting; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Predictive analytics; Learning methods; NAtural language processing; Prediction tasks; Stock indices; Stock predictions; Structured data; Deep learning",,,,,,,"Abdel-Hamid, O., Mohamed, A.

Our proposed model uses Machine Learning algorithms along with Parallel Computing processing to provide a new trading technique for non-stationary and multidimensional financial data of Reliance Industries retrieved from Dematerialized account from up STOX Application Programming Interface (API) which extract data at regular interval of 10 minutes. This proposed model uses K-means machine learning technique to models the gathered stock data and predicts the upcoming stock values well in advance with parallel processing techniques. This paper provides the analysis of previous year's stock market pricing data and interpret results after performing intensive training based on machine learning algorithm on Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) considering the time constraint of real time trading. The performance of the system is improved drastically with the help of machine learning techniques and to accelerate the process of generating the results, a technique of parallel computing is used in this paper. The performance time is significantly reduced because of high performance speed using CUDA parallel computing technology compared to traditional methods of single Central Processing Unit (CPU). It helped in reduction of calculation time by large margin and hence to gain book profit which is the ultimate goal of trading by predicting the stock values well in advance. Investors can decide whether to keep that stock, sell it or buy some other new stocks or neutral decision on basis of 3 clusters as predicted k means algorithm.

Stock values fluctuate in accordance with time and hence suitability of Recursive Neural Network (RNN) as one of the model for prediction of stocks is a niche choice as a predictor. The temporal pattern of financial market is investigated with plain RNN and also with Long Short Term Memory (LSTM). In contrast to the classical time series forecasting, the widespread use of deep learning network and algorithms using temporal statistical relations built upon RNN have been finding increasing applications in time series domain analysis and provide a better yield in terms of performance. We have implemented temporal logic using Keras framework and show the results on the sequential data sets of stock prediction market. Our main focus is solely on stock prediction using time series forecasting, however, it can be extended to risk assessment, portfolio management etc. The imperative is to use this as a basis model for further investigation and explore additionally with trend forecasting, crypto currency forecasting and many more. Although this area is matured enough, with machine learning techniques, it provides tremendous opportunities for further investigations and improvements thereon. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

As a result, numerous studies have been conducted on the stock-market prediction using technical or fundamental analysis through various soft-computing techniques and algorithms. This study attempted to undertake a systematic and critical review of about one hundred and twenty-two (122) pertinent research works reported in academic journals over 11 years (2007–2018) in the area of stock market prediction using machine learning. The various techniques identified from these reports were clustered into three categories, namely technical, fundamental, and combined analyses. The grouping was done based on the following criteria: the nature of a dataset and the number of data sources used, the data timeframe, the machine learning algorithms used, machine learning task, used accuracy and error metrics and software packages used for modelling. The results revealed that 66% of documents reviewed were based on technical analysis; whiles 23% and 11% were based on fundamental analysis and combined analyses, respectively. Concerning the number of data source, 89.34% of documents reviewed, used single sources; whiles 8.2% and 2.46% used two and three sources respectively.

A system that can forecast, predict the stock prices and automatically create a portfolio of top performing stocks is of great value to individual investors who do not have sufficient knowledge to understand the complex dynamics involved in evaluating and predicting stock prices. In this paper the authors propose a Stock prediction, Portfolio Generation and Selection model based on Machine learning algorithms, Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are used for stock price prediction, Mathematical and Statistical techniques are used for Portfolio generation and Un-Supervised Machine learning based on K-Means Clustering algorithms are used for Portfolio Evaluation and Selection which take in to account the Portfolio Return and Risk in to consideration. The model presented here is limited to predicting stock prices on a long term basis as the inputs to the model are based on fundamental attributes and intrinsic value of the stock. The results of this study are quite encouraging as the stock prediction models are able predict stock prices at least a financial quarter in advance with an accuracy of around 90 percent and the portfolio selection classifiers are giving returns in excess of average market returns. © 2020 Korean Society of Management Information Systems.","Artificial intelligence (AI); Artificial neural networks (ANN); K-Means; Machine learning (ML); Multi-layer perceptron (MLP); Stock portfolio; Stock prediction",,,,,,,,"Agrawal, S., Thakkar, D., Soni, D., Bhimani, K., Patel, C., Stock market prediction using machine learning techniques (2019) Data Collection Feature Extraction Data Normalization Training Output, 5 (2), pp. 1099-1103; Anbalagan, T., Maheswari, S.U., Classification and prediction of stock market index based on Fuzzy Metagraph (2014) Procedia Computer Science, 47, pp. 214-221. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procs.2015.03.200; Arik, S., Eryilmaz, S.B., Goldberg, A., (2014) Supervised classification-based stock prediction and portfolio optimization, , http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.0824; Banik, S., Khodadad Khan, A.F.M., Anwer, M., Hybrid machine learning technique for forecasting dhaka stock market timing decisions (2014) Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience, , https://doi.org/10.1155/2014/318524; Bouckaert, R.R., Frank, E., Hall, M., Kirkby, R., Reutemann, P., Seewald, A., Scuse, D., (2017) WEKA Manual for Version-8-; Cenesizoglu, T., Papageorgiou, N., Reeves, J.J., Wu, H., An analysis on the predictability of CAPM beta for momentum returns (2019) Journal of Forecasting, 38 (2), pp. 136-153. , https://doi.org/10.1002/for.2552; Cheng, C., Chen, Y., Fundamental analysis of stock trading systems using classification techniques (2007) Proceedings of the Sixth International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics, pp. 19-22. , Hong Kong, 19-22 August 2007; Chong, E., Han, C., Park, F., Deep learning networks for stock market analysis and prediction (2017) Expert Systems with Applications, 83, pp. 187-205. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2017.04.030, (April); Dase, R.K., Pawar, D.D., Application of artificial neural network for stock market predictions: A review of literature (2010) International Journal of Machine Intelligence, 2 (2), pp. 14-17. , https://doi.org/10.9735/0975-2927.2.2.14-17; Di Persio, L., Honchar, O., Artificial neural networks architectures for stock price prediction: Comparisons and applications (2016) International Journal of Circuits, Systems and Signal Processing, 10, pp. 403-413. , https://doi.org/10.1676/09-204.1; Diakoulakis, I.E., Koulouriotis, D.E., Emiris, D.M., A Review of Stock Market Prediction Using Computational Methods (2018) Computational Methods in Decision-Making, Economics and Finance, 74. , https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4757-3613-7_20, Kontoghiorghes E.J., Rustem B., Siokos S.

Since then, major firms and hedge funds have adopted machine learning for stock prediction, portfolio optimization, credit lending, stock betting, etc. In this paper, we survey all the different approaches of machine learning that can be incorporated in applied finance. The major motivation behind ML is to draw out the specifics from the available data from different sources and to forecast from it. Different machine learning algorithms has their abilities for predictions and are heavily depended on the number and quality of parameters as input features.

This paper attempts to use the latest artificial intelligence technologies to design and implement a framework for financial asset price prediction. The framework we use is divided into three modules: Feature Engineering, Regressor, and Hyper Optimizer. The Feature Engineering module extract multiple features using technical indicators, FinBERT, FFT, ARIMA, stacked auto-encoder, PCA and XGBoost. The Regressor module consists of a generative adversarial network, where the generator is Seq2Seq and the discriminator is GRU. The HyperOptimizer module will tune the parameter in GAN using the Bayesian optimization algorithm. Finally, we conducted numerical experiments on our framework, which shows that the framework implemented in this paper performs better than the benchmark method. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Bayesian optimization; GAN; NLP; Stacked autoencoder; Stock prediction","Electronic trading; Financial markets; Forecasting; Information retrieval; Machine learning; Numerical methods; Predictive analytics; Adversarial networks; Artificial intelligence technologies; Bayesian optimization algorithms; Design and implements; Feature engineerings; Integrated machines; Numerical experiments; Stock price prediction; Fintech",,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 61772044

In this work we report on the development, implementation and application of a data-driven, statistical method for mapping SOC stocks in space and time, using Argentina as a pilot. We used quantile regression forest machine learning to predict annual SOC stock at 0–30 cm depth at 250 m resolution for Argentina between 1982 and 2017. The model was calibrated using over 5,000 SOC stock values from the 36-year time period and 35 environmental covariates. We preprocessed normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) dynamic covariates using a temporal low-pass filter to allow the SOC stock for a given year to depend on the NDVI of the current as well as preceding years. Predictions had modest temporal variation, with an average decrease for the entire country from 2.55 to 2.48 kg C m−2 over the 36-year period (equivalent to a decline of 211 Gg C, 3.0% of the total 0–30 cm SOC stock in Argentina). The Pampa region had a larger estimated SOC stock decrease from 4.62 to 4.34 kg C m−2 (5.9%) during the same period. For the 2001–2015 period, predicted temporal variation was seven-fold larger than that obtained using the Tier 1 approach of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification. Prediction uncertainties turned out to be substantial, mainly due to the limited number and poor spatial and temporal distribution of the calibration data, and the limited explanatory power of the covariates. Cross-validation confirmed that SOC stock prediction accuracy was limited, with a mean error of 0.03 kg C m−2 and a root mean squared error of 2.04 kg C m−2. In spite of the large uncertainties, this work showed that machine learning methods can be used for space–time SOC mapping and may yield valuable information to land managers and policymakers, provided that SOC observation density in space and time is sufficiently large. © 2020 The Authors.

The enormous stock market volatility emphasizes the need to effectively assess the role of external factors in stock prediction. Stock markets can be predicted using machine learning algorithms on information contained in social media and financial news, as this data can change investors’ behavior. In this paper, we use algorithms on social media and financial news data to discover the impact of this data on stock market prediction accuracy for ten subsequent days. For improving performance and quality of predictions, feature selection and spam tweets reduction are performed on the data sets. Moreover, we perform experiments to find such stock markets that are difficult to predict and those that are more influenced by social media and financial news. We compare results of different algorithms to find a consistent classifier. Finally, for achieving maximum prediction accuracy, deep learning is used and some classifiers are ensembled. Our experimental results show that highest prediction accuracies of 80.53% and 75.16% are achieved using social media and financial news, respectively. We also show that New York and Red Hat stock markets are hard to predict, New York and IBM stocks are more influenced by social media, while London and Microsoft stocks by financial news.

The financial market always tends to be a great challenge for experts to predict the future stock prices. Hence, market experts use varied differential techniques such as fundamental or technical to determine the financial forecasting. In past, there exist various regression models, such as ARIMA, ARCH, and GARCH which are used for technical analysis, but they tend to be less robust for non-stationary data. Moreover, varied machine learning algorithms are applied in the past which include SVM and random forest for financial forecasting. However, results retrieved from these algorithms are still questionable with time series data. In the current study of approach, we have utilized deep learning models which have a tendency to be more focused on right features by themselves; it requires very little intervention of developer. Hence, deep learning methods can increase the ability of technical analysis for future stock prediction. In this paper, varied comparison is drawn among the two deep learning approaches such as LSTM and CNN which are applied to predict the future stock prices of Infosys company. Empirically, it has been proved that the LSTM outperforms the CNN. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Financial data; Long short-term memory; Neural network; Recurrent neural network","Commerce; Convolutional neural networks; Costs; Decision trees; Deep neural networks; Electronic trading; Financial markets; Forecasting; Learning systems; Long short-term memory; Neural networks; Random forests; Recurrent neural networks; Regression analysis; Differential technique; Financial data; Financial forecasting; Learning approach; Learning techniques; Nonstationary data; Stock predictions; Technical analysis; Deep learning",,,,,,,"Huang, W., Nakamori, Y., Wang, S.-Y., Forecasting stock market movement direction with support vector machine (2005) Computers and Operations Research, 32 (10), pp. 2513-2522; Lin, S., Runger, G.C., GCRNN: Group-constrained convolutional recurrent neural network (2018) IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems, 29 (10), pp. 4709-4718; Lauretto, M.S., Silva, B.C., Andrade, P.M., (2013) Evaluation of a Supervised Learning Approach for Stock Market Operations; Lee, J.W., Park, J., Jangmin, O., Lee, J., Hong, E., A multiagent approach to Q-learning for daily stock trading (2007) IEEE Transactions on Systems, MAN and Cybernetics—Part A: Systems and Humans, 37 (6), pp. 864-877; Zhang, L., Liu, N., Yu, P., A novel instantaneous frequency algorithm and its application in stock index movement prediction (2012) IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing, 6 (4), pp. 311-318; Idrees, S.M., Alam, M.A., Agarwal, P., A prediction approach for stock market volatility based on time series data (2019) IEEE Access, 7, pp. 17287-17298; Saad, E.W., Prokhorov, D.V., Wunsch, D.C., Comparative study of stock trend prediction using time delay, recurrent and probabilistic neural networks (1998) IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks, 9 (6), pp. 1456-1470; Minh, D.L., Sadeghi-Niaraki, A., Huy, H.D., Min, K., Moon, H.-J., Deep learning approach for short-term stock trends prediction based on two-stream gated recurrent unit network (2018) IEEE Access, 6, pp. 55392-55404; Chou, J.-S., Nguyen, T.-K., Forward forecast of stock price using sliding-window metaheuristic-optimized machine-learning regression (2018) IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics, 14 (7), pp. 3132-3142; Chen, L., Qiao, Z., Wang, M., Wang, C., Du, R., Stanley, H.E., Which artificial intelligence algorithm better predicts the chinese stock market?

The best provided services will be increasing the rating of those services subsequently annotated with their good feedback. To give feedback one platform is social media like twitter is very suitable one. To attain consumers interest on their services, consumer markets utilizes advertisements via search engine marketing and social media platforms. The advertisements are very attractive and mind catching, people will be informed, motivated, influenced. All advertisers give advertises in form of text, picture, and video, audio and by mixing them with the aid of professional ad-makers. The search engine is a search program for finding particular sites on World Wide Web, which discovers the stuff related to keywords or characters specified by the user. In an increasingly competitive marketplace to expand and grow the business the Search engine marketing (SEM) is the effective approach. The advertisers also select video sharing platforms like YouTube-a video sharing channel, and also the search engine marketing platform to launch their advertisements to be available for consumers publicly. The public can view and share their opinion via likes/dislikes count and also comments for every video. This paper focus on attaining stock predictions from different sources and also discuss about gathering text analysis for the required stock from digital media like search engines, video channels, news feeds. The aim of this study is to consider the stock price prediction from major E-commerce consumer services companies namely Just Dial and Info edge that are publicly traded in NSE/BSE by considering web advertising and their influence on consumer services markets like Just Dial and Info edge, by adopting ensemble machine learning algorithms like Random forest, Gradient boost, XG-boost and it is observed that XG Boost outperforms the other algorithms as it exhibits least RMSE,MAE and MAPE providing the accuracy of 71.78%. © 2020 Lavoisier.

Traditional methods mainly rely on quantitative trading data to make predictions. With the increasing volume of Web information, researchers begin to extract effective indicators (e.g., the events and sentiments) from the Web to facilitate the prediction. It is beneficial to fuse the heterogeneous multi-sourced data to achieve superior performance. Existing solutions adopt simple data fusing methods with conventional machine learning models, which may fail to effectively model the complex interactions among the data. With the success of deep neural networks (DNN) in various fields, we propose a DNN-based model that considers the various interactions and complex correlations among the multi-sourced data into one unified framework. In such a framework, the low-and high-order feature interactions are modeled with the factorization machine and the deep neural network respectively, and stock correlations are incorporated with an attention-based feature embedding method. Evaluations on the stock data from the year 2015 to 2017 show that our model can outperform the state-of-the-art methods. © 2019 IEEE.","attention mechanism; feature interaction; stock prediction","Big data; Commerce; Complex networks; Electronic trading; Embeddings; Financial markets; Forecasting; Attention mechanisms; Complex correlation; Conventional machines; Factorization machines; Feature interactions; State-of-the-art methods; Stock market prediction; Stock predictions; Deep neural networks",,,,,,,"Chong, E., Han, C., Park, F.C., Deep learning networks for stock market analysis and prediction: Methodology, data representationss, and case studies (2017) Expert Systems with Applications, 83, pp. 187-205; Tetlock, P.C., Giving content to investor sentiment: The role of media in the stock market (2007) Journal of Finance, 62 (3), pp. 1139-1168; https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/market-quavers-after-fake-ap-tweet-says-obama-was-hurt-in-white-house-explosions/2013/04/23/d96d2dc6-ac4d-lle2-a8b9-2a63d75b5459_story.htmlnoredirect=on; Li, X., Huang, X., Deng, X., Zhu, S., Enhancing quantitative intra-day stock return prediction by integrating both market news and stock prices information (2014) Neurocomputing, 142, pp. 228-238; Schumaker, R.P., Chen, H., A quantitative stock prediction system based on financial news (2009) Inf.

However, dry forest ecosystems in Ecuador are endangered to become a source of carbon emissions because of deforestation. Often spatial information, necessary to quantify potential carbon loss to the atmosphere, is missing. This particularly applies to remote areas of limited accessibility. This study aims to regionalise the SOC stocks of a small and poorly accessible dry forest ecosystem in southwestern Ecuador by using boosted regression tree (BRT) models. Resampling in a nested repeated k-fold cross validation approach was applied to develop robust models for a dataset of 118 samples with limited predictor information. To select an optimal set of model parameters, optimisation by differential evolution (DE) was applied for parameter tuning. Predictor selection was implemented using the same optimisation algorithm. This study demonstrates how the predictive performance of BRT models can be improved by applying an optimisation approach for parameter tuning and predictor selection. Model performance was improved by approximately 40% concerning the R2. Still, the results also demonstrated the difficulties of machine learning applications in small and highly heterogeneous natural areas. Very variable or even random factors were assumed to distort the relationship between predictor and response variables. We assume that the presented approach is particularly successful in the case of a real-valued multivariate space of tuning parameters. However, this requires testing in further machine learning applications and algorithms. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Cross validation; Differential evolution; Dry forest; Machine learning; Model fitting; Soil organic carbon","Deforestation; Ecosystems; Evolutionary algorithms; Greenhouse gases; Learning systems; Optimization; Organic carbon; Cross validation; Differential Evolution; Dry forests; Model fitting; Soil organic carbon; Machine learning; algorithm; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; concentration (composition); deforestation; dry forest; forest ecosystem; forest soil; greenhouse gas; machine learning; model validation; optimization; organic carbon; prediction; soil ecosystem; topsoil",,,,,"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG: LI 2360/1-1

The current work clearly describes the prediction of a stock using Machine Learning. The adoption of machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques to predict the prices of the stock is a growing trend. More and more researchers invest their time every day in coming up with ways to arrive at techniques that can further improve the accuracy of the stock prediction model. This paper is mainly concerned with the best model to predict the stock market value. During the mechanism of contemplating the various techniques and variables that can be taken into consideration, we discovered five models Which are based on supervised learning techniques i.e.., Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Bernoulli Naïve Bayes.The empirical results show that SVC performs the best for large datasets and Random Forest, Naïve Bayes is the best for small datasets. The successful prediction for the stock will be a great asset for the stock market institutions and will provide real-life solutions to the problems that stock investors face. © BEIESP.","Data pre-processing; Dataset; Machine Learning; Predictions; Stock Market; Supervised Learning Algorithms",,,,,,,,"Zhang, G., Patuwo, B.E., Hu, M.Y., Forecasting with Artificial Neural Networks: The state of the art (1998) Int.

Many techniques have been developed for analysis of stock market, however, it remains a challenging problem. One approach is to use deep learning for stock price prediction and some success has been reported in literature with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). This paper proposes deep functional link neural network for stock predictions as functional link artificial neural networks (FLANN) are single-layer neural networks which can solve complex problems by generating nonlinear decision boundaries. It is conjectured that deep FLANN would benefit from the ability of deep learning to handle complex problems generated from multiple hidden layers and interconnection of neurons as well as from the inherent capability of single layer FLANN to handle difficult problems. Initial investigations show that average performance of Deep FLANN is better than the single-layer FLANN as well as CNN for prediction of stock prices of a set of companies listed on Korean Stock market. © 2019 IEEE.","Artificial Intelligence; Artificial Neural Network; Convolutional neural network; Deep Functional link artificial neural network; Fumctional link artificial neural network; Machine Learning","Commerce; Complex networks; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Electronic trading; Financial markets; Forecasting; Network layers; Power control; Complex problems; Decision boundary; Functional link artificial neural networks; Functional link neural network; Korean stock market; Stock predictions; Stock price prediction; Wealth management; Multilayer neural networks",,,,,,,"Iyer, M., Mehra, R., A survey on stock market prediction (2018) 2018 Fifth International Conference on Parallel, Distributed and Grid Computing (PDGC), pp. 663-668. , December.

Fruitful forecasts of stock market lead to high investment gains. Analysis of stock market data has always been a hot area of research due to the large number of factors affecting the stock market. In the last few years, researchers have utilized machine learning techniques for learning the trends of stock market in order to improve the accuracy of predictions. However, authors have applied these techniques individually and compared their results. Since the aggregated opinion of a group of models is relatively less noisy as compared to the single opinion of one of the models, this paper presents an ensemble machine learning approach for predicting the stock market. The weighted ensemble model is built using weighted support vector regression (SVR), Long-short term memory (LSTM) and Multiple Regression. From the results it is observed that ensemble learning approach is able to attain maximum accuracy with reduced variance and hence better predictions. © 2019 IEEE.","Ensemble approach; Long Short Term Memory; Multiple Regression; Support Vector Regression","Brain; Commerce; Financial markets; Forecasting; Investments; Machine learning; Regression analysis; Ensemble approaches; Ensemble learning approach; Machine learning approaches; Machine learning techniques; Maximum accuracies; Multiple regressions; Stock market prediction; Support vector regression (SVR); Long short-term memory",,,,,,,"Narayanan, B., Govindarajan, M., Prediction of stock market using ensemble model (2015) Int.

In this respect, 3D modelling of soil organic carbon (SOC) offers substantial improvements in the understanding and assessment of the spatial distribution of SOC stocks. Previous three-dimensional SOC modelling approaches usually averaged each depth increment for multi-layer two-dimensional predictions. Therefore, these models are limited in their vertical resolution and thus in the interpretability of the soil as a volume as well as in the accuracy of the SOC stock predictions. So far, only few approaches used spatially modelled depth functions for SOC predictions. This study implemented and evaluated an approach that compared polynomial, logarithmic and exponential depth functions using non-linear machine learning techniques, i.e. multivariate adaptive regression splines, random forests and support vector machines to quantify SOC stocks spatially and depth-related in the context of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning research. The legacy datasets used for modelling include profile data for SOC and bulk density (BD), sampled at five depth increments (0-5, 5-10, 10-20, 20-30, 30-50 cm). The samples were taken in an experimental forest in the Chinese subtropics as part of the biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (BEF) China experiment. Here we compared the depth functions by means of the results of the different machine learning approaches obtained based on multi-layer 2D models as well as 3D models. The main findings were (i) that 3rd degree polynomials provided the best results for SOC and BD (R2 = 0.99 and R2 = 0.98; RMSE = 0.36% and 0.07 g cm-3). However, they did not adequately describe the general asymptotic trend of SOC and BD. In this respect the exponential (SOC: R2 = 0.94; RMSE = 0.56%) and logarithmic (BD: R2 = 84; RMSE = 0.21 g cm-3) functions provided more reliable estimates. (ii) random forests with the exponential function for SOC correlated better with the corresponding 2.5D predictions (R2: 0.96 to 0.75), compared to the 3rd degree polynomials (R2: 0.89 to 0.15) which support vector machines fitted best. We recommend not to use polynomial functions with sparsely sampled profiles, as they have many turning points and tend to overfit the data on a given profile. This may limit the spatial prediction capacities. Instead, less adaptive functions with a higher degree of generalisation such as exponential and logarithmic functions should be used to spatially map sparse vertical soil profile datasets. We conclude that spatial prediction of SOC using exponential depth functions, in conjunction with random forests is well suited for 3D SOC stock modelling, and provides much finer vertical resolutions compared to 2.5D approaches. © 2019 Rentschler et al.

Recent years have witnessed increasing efforts in applying machine learning techniques, especially deep learning, to pursue more promising stock prediction. While deep learning has given rise to significant improvement, human investors still retain the leading position due to their understanding on stock intrinsic properties, which can imply invaluable principles for stock prediction. In this paper, we propose to extract and explore stock intrinsic properties to enhance stock trend prediction. Fortunately, we discover that the repositories of investment behaviors within mutual fund portfolio data form up a gold mine to extract latent representations of stock properties, since such collective investment behaviors can reflect the professional fund managers' common beliefs on stock intrinsic properties. Powered by extracted stock properties, we further propose to model the dynamic market state and trend using stock representations so as to generate the dynamic correlation between the stock and the market, and then we aggregate such correlation with dynamic stock indicators to achieve more accurate stock prediction. Extensive experiments on real-world stock market data demonstrate the effectiveness of stock properties extracted from collective investment behaviors in the task of stock prediction. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Matrix Factorization; Mutual Fund Portfolio Data; Stock Prediction","Commerce; Data mining; Deep learning; Factorization; Financial markets; Forecasting; Dynamic correlation; Intrinsic property; Machine learning techniques; Matrix factorizations; Mutual funds; Stock indicators; Stock predictions; Stock trend prediction; Investments",,,,,"SQ2018YFB140235

The higher investment value obtained by a country, the faster the country is able to develop their prosperity. However, the investor faces some obstacle in investment activity to have a reasonable return and acceptable risk. In stock investments area, investors could increase chance of getting higher returns by making predictions and diversifying by forming a stock portfolio. Previous studies have stated that Artificial Neural Network (ANN), which are one of the machine learning models inspired by the activity of human brain cells have more advantages to predict the stock future value in terms of speed, accuracy, and the amount of data that can be processed compared to other stock prediction models. Diversification is a method of dividing investment funds into different index stocks, with the aim of reducing the investment risk. With thousands of stocks in the market, deciding which portfolio should be chosen is difficult. This study extends the scope of several previous studies, which are only limited to perform predictions using ANN or GA without forming an optimal stock portfolio. The objective of this study is to predict future stock values using ANN, then form those optimal stock portfolios using GA with aims to get the best optimization of maximal return and minimal risk value. The results of this study show, the implementation of GA as an alternative to the Single Index Model (SIM) method show better optimization index. © 2019 IEEE.","Artificial Neural Network; Genetic Algorithm; Investment; Machine Learning; Prediction; Single Index Model; Stock Portfolio","Brain; Financial data processing; Financial markets; Forecasting; Genetic algorithms; Investments; Learning systems; Machine learning; Multivariable control systems; Neural networks; Economic growths; Investment funds; Investment risks; Machine learning models; Portfolio optimization; Single index models; Stock portfolio; Stock predictions; Economics",,,,,,,"(2016) KSEI (Indonesia Central Securities Depository), , Press Release : Raih Rekor Baru, Jumlah Investor Tercatat Naik 26%, Indonesia : PT KSEI; (2017) KSEI (Indonesia Central Securities Depository), , Press Release : KSEI Terus Upayakan Kemudahan Pembukaan Rekening Investasi Indonesia : PT KSEI; Sula, M.S., (2004) Sharia Insurance (Life and General): Concepts and Operating Systems, , (in Indonesia) Asuransi Syariah (Life and General): Konsep dan Sistem Operasional.

Machine learning tools such as Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) have proven effective in solving classification problems. Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) has been deemed to be the state of the art of the ANN family, which is specialized in tracking time series related data. The capability of LSTM as a powerful tool for making profit has been reported, along with its reputation for stock market prediction. In this study, Keras was used as a neural network library on top of Tensorflow as a machine learning backend using the Dow Jones Index (DJI) as the data source for the MLP and LSTM analyses. Our experimental results reveal that the prediction ability of MLP and LSTM possesses similar accuracy to the benchmark when providing only trading price and volume as the input data. This paper further discusses some difficulties in training MLP and LSTM that may have reduced the system capability to reach its expected potential. © 2019 IEEE.","Artificial Neural Network; Deep learning; Index Prediction; Keras; Long Short Term Memory (LSTM); Multilayer Perceptron (MLP); Stock Prediction; Tensorflow","Brain; Commerce; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Electronic trading; Financial markets; Forecasting; Machine learning; Multilayer neural networks; Neural networks; Index predictions; Keras; Multi layer perceptron; Stock predictions; Tensorflow; Long short-term memory",,,,,,,"Fama, E.F., French, K.R., Dividend yields and expected stock returns (1988) Journal of Financial Economics, 22, pp. 3-25; Fama, E.F., French, K.R., The cross-section of expected stock returns (1992) Journal of Finance, 47, pp. 427-465; Fama, F.E.F., Kenneth, R., Common risk factors in the returns on stocks and bonds (1993) Journal of FinancialEconomics, 33 (1), pp. 3-56; Chan, L.K.C., Hamano, Y., Lakonishok, J., Fundamentals and stock returns in Japan (1991) Journal of Finance, 46, pp. 1739-1764; Schumaker, R.P., Chen, H., Textual analysis of stock market prediction using breaking financial news: The AZFin text system (2009) ACM Transactions on Information Systems (TOIS), 27 (2). , December; Schumaker, R.P., Chen, H., A quantitative stock prediction system based on financial news (2009) Information Processing & Management, 45 (5), pp. 571-583; Hagenau, M., Liebmann, M., Neumann, D., Automated news reading: Stock price prediction based on financial news using context-capturing features (2013) Decision Support Systems, 55 (3), pp. 685-697; Jensen, M.C., Benington, G.A., Random walks and technical theories: Some additional evidence (1970) The Journal of Finance, 25, pp. 469-482; Gervais, S., Kaniel, R., Mingelgrin, D.H., The High-Volume Return premium (2001) The Journal of Finance, 56, pp. 877-919; Schierholt, K., Dagli, C.H., Stock market prediction using different neural network classification architectures (1996) CIFErl996, pp. 72-78. , IEEE, March; Guresen, E., Kayakutlu, G., Daim, T.U., Using artificial neural network models in stock market index prediction (2011) Expert Systems with Applications, 38 (8), pp. 10389-10397; Fischer, T., Krauss, C., Deep learning with long short-term memory networks for financial market predictions (2018) European Journal of Operational Research, 270 (2), pp. 654-669; Nelson, D.M., Pereira, A.C., De Oliveira, R.A., Stock market's price movement prediction with LSTM neural networks (2017) IJCNN2017 Conference, pp. 1419-1426. , May",,,"et al.;Kobe Convention Bureau;NSK-FAM;SECOM Science and Technology Foundation;The University Adelaide;University of Hyogo","IEEE Computer Society","18th International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics, ICMLC 2019","7 July 2019 through 10 July 2019",,156687,2160133X,9781728128160,,,"English","Proc.

Based on that fact, stock price become very difficult to be predicted or even estimated. Therefore, analysis of stock price movement predictions is heavily required as investment decision reference for investor. This paper uses technical analysis with Artificial Neural Network Backpropagation method as one of machine learning methodology which has commonly used along with rapid development of data mining and big data analytic that produces a prediction with high accuracy and the least error. The objects in this paper were four companies in the agricultural and mining sector, which was among Kompas100 index with the largest market capitalization in the period of 2013 to 2018. Based on the results of research with several variations of the experiment using varying hidden layer values 10, 20, 30 with variations in SGD values: 0.01, 0.001 and 0.0001 as well as variations in epoch 100, 200 and 300 values, resulting in network predictive models that provide training with error rates the minimum error is in the 5-20-1 model with a value of SGD 0.01 and epoch 300. Accuracy performance prediction of using MAE, MSE, RMSE and MAPE shows that the deviation of the predicted values of Artificial Neural Network Backpropagation from the actual values at agricultural and mining stock prices is low enough to conclude that stock predictions are accurate © 2019 IEEE.","Artificial Neural Network; Backpropagation; Machine learning; Stock Price Prediction; Technical Analysis","Agriculture; Commerce; Costs; Data mining; Electronic trading; Errors; Financial markets; Forecasting; Investments; Learning systems; Machine learning; Motion estimation; Neural networks; Investment decisions; Market capitalization; Performance prediction; Predictive models; Stock predictions; Stock price movement predictions; Stock price prediction; Technical analysis; Backpropagation",,,,,,,"(2018) Perkembangan Ekonomi Indonesia Dan Dunia, , Kementrian PPN/Bappenas, Triwulan I Tahun; (2018) Indonesia-investments, , [Online], Commodinties of Indonesia; (2018) IDX Monthly Statistics, 27 (6). , Indonesia Stock Exchange, June; Artha, D.R., Achsani, N.Z., Sasongko, H., Analisa fundamental teknikal dan makroekonomi harga saham sektor pertanian (2014) Jurnal Manajemen Dan Kewirausahaan, 16 (2), pp. 175-183. , Sept; Patel, M.B., Yalamalle, S.R., Stock price prediction using artficial neural network (2014) International Journal of Innovative Research in Science, Engineering & Technology, 3 (6), pp. 13755-13762; Paik, P., Kumari, B., Stock market prediction using ann, SVM, elm: A review (2017) International Journal of Emerging Trends & Technology in Computer Science (IJETTCS), pp. 88-94; Bahrun, P.N., Taib, M.N., Selected Malaysia stock predictions using artificial neural network (2009) Journal on 5th International Colloquium on Signal Processing & Its Applications (CSPA), pp. 428-431; Soni, S., Application of anns in stock market prediction : A survey (2011) International Journal of Computer Science & Engineering Technology (IJCSET), pp. 71-83; Kodrat, D.S., Indonanjaya, K., (2010) Manajemen Investasi: Pendekatan Teknikal Dan Fundamental Untuk Analisis Saham, , Graha Ilmu, Yogyakarta; Siahaan, L.E., Umbara, R.F., Sibaroni, Y., Prediksi indeks harga saham dengan metode gabungan support vector regression dan jaringan syaraf tiruan (2017) Ind.

Most of them are interested in knowing the stock price trend in the future. To get a precise and winning model is the wish of them. Recently, Neural Network has been a prevalent means for stock prediction. However, there are many ways and different predicting models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). In this paper, we propose a novel idea that average previous five days stock market information (open, high, low, volume, close) as a new value then use this value to predict, and use the predicted value as the average of the stock price information for the next five days. Moreover, we utilize Technical Analysis Indicators to consider whether to buy stocks or continue to hold stocks or sell stocks.

Stock prices are driven by a number of factors: industry performance, company news and performance, investor confidence, micro and macro economic factors like employment rates, wage rates, etc. Stock pricing trends can be gauged from the factors that drive it as well as from the stock's historical performance. As fluctuations in stock prices become more volatile and unpredictable, forecasting models help reduce some of the randomness involved in investing and financial decision making. Users on social media platforms like twitter, StockTwits, and eToro discuss issues related to the stock market. Can the analysis of posts on StockTwits add value to the existing features of stock price predicting models? An existing model that uses twits as features was extended to include sentiment analysis of the text referenced by the URL in the twits to see if the model accuracy did improve. Initial results indicate that the addition of sentiment analysis of the text referenced by the URL does not improve the performance of the model when all twits for a given day are taken into account since the model only identifies the direction of change and not the degree of change. The stock prediction model achieves 65% accuracy compared to the base case accuracy of 44% and augmenting the model with sentiment analysis did not change the accuracy. The study highlights some interesting observations regarding users on the StockTwits social media platform and proposes the need for a domain specific sentiment analyzer in future work. © 2019 IEEE.","Big data; Index Terms—stock market; Machine learning; Sentiment analysis; Social media","Application programs; Big data; Commerce; Costs; Decision making; Digital storage; Employment; Financial markets; Forecasting; Learning systems; Sentiment analysis; Social networking (online); Financial decisions; Forecasting models; Forecasting stock prices; Historical performance; Index terms; International economy; Social media; Social media platforms; Investments",,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: #ACI-14 61264","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was sponsored in part by a National Science Foundation grant #ACI-14 61264 supporting research experience for undergraduates (REU).","Bollen, J., Mao, H., Zeng, X., Twitter mood predicts the stock market (2011) Journal of Computational Science, 2 (1), pp. 1-8; Cheng, E., Just 10% of trading is regular stock picking (2017) JPMorgan Estimates; Coyne, S., Madiraju, P., Coelho, J., (2017) Forecasting Stock Prices Using Social Media Analysis; Gilbert, E., Karahalios, K., Widespread worry and the stock market (2010) Proceedings of the 4th International AAAI Conference on Weblogs and Social Media, pp. 58-65; Kimoto, T., Asakawa, K., Yoda, M., Takeoka, M., Stock market prediction system with modular neural networks (1990) 1990 IJCNN International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, pp. 1-6. , 1; Li, M., Yang, C., Zhang, J., Puthal, D., Luo, Y., Li, J., Stock market analysis using social networks (2018) Proceedings of the Australasian Computer Science Week Multiconference on - ACSW’18, pp. 1-10; Mao, Y., Wang, B., Wei, W., Liu, B., Correlating S&P 500 stocks with twitter data (2012) Proceedings of the First ACM International Workshop on Hot Topics on Interdisciplinary Social Networks Research, pp. 69-72; Nicola, S., (2019) Wirecard Plunges on Report Claiming Officials Knew of Book-Padding; Oh, C., Sheng, O., Investigating predictive power of stock micro blog sentiment in forecasting future stock price directional movement (2011) Icis, pp. 1-19; Oliveira, N., Cortez, P., Areal, N., On the predictability of stock market behavior using StockTwits sentiment and posting volume (2013) Lecture Notes in Computer Science (Including Subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics), 8154, pp. 355-365; Quandl, Financial, Economic and Alternative Data; (2017) StockTwits® - Share Ideas & Learn from Passionate Investors & Traders, , StockTwits; Sun, T., Wang, J., Zhang, P., Cao, Y., Liu, B., Wang, D., Predicting stock price returns using microblog sentiment for Chinese stock market (2017) Proceedings - 2017 3rd International Conference on Big Data Computing and Communications, BigCom 2017, pp. 87-96; Tu, W., Cheung, D.W., Mamoulis, N., Yang, M., Lu, Z., Investment Recommendation using Investor Opinions in Social Media (2016) Proceedings of the 39th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval - SIGIR’16, pp. 881-884; (2016) Resources // Textual Analysis // Software Repository for Accounting and Finance, , University of Notre Dame.

Finance time series data has a high complexity, so that the acurate prediction is hard to be gained by standard model. Machine learning becomes the new prediction tool which is often used because of its adaptive properties. Neural Network (NN) is one of the machine learning which able to complete inference tasks such as prediction, especially in large data sets. FFNN is one of the NN models that has simple network architecture. In the standard optimization method, the initial weights is randomly selected to desire the optimum solution. But It usually raises the problem of unsteady estimation. The GA optimization method was applied in this research to overcome this lack. GA optimizes any function effectively and seeks a global optimum solution efficiently. GA implementation on the FFNN was aimed to obtain optimum weights that minimizing the error. The daily stock price prediction of PT. Adhi Karya Tbk had RMSE of training and testing data at 51.2531 and 44.8706 respectively.

To better model the temporal dynamics of stock price, we propose a combined machine learning framework with information theory and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). This method creatively uses information entropy to inform non-linear causality as well as stock relevance and uses it to facilitate the ANN time series modeling. Our analysis with Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Apple stock prices demonstrates the feasibility of this machine learning framework. © 2019 IEEE.","LSTM; Neural network; Stock prediction; Transfer entropy","Commerce; Electronic trading; Financial markets; Information management; Information theory; Investments; Machine learning; Neural networks; System stability; Information entropy; Investment strategy; LSTM; Stock predictions; Stock price prediction; Temporal dynamics; Time series modeling; Transfer entropy; Long short-term memory",,,,,,,"Gerasimo, M., Konstantions, P., Yannis, T., Babis, T., Intelligent stock market assistant using temporal data mining (2005) Proc. of 10th Panhellenics Conference in Informatics (PCI05), , Volos, Greece; Roh, T.H., Forecasting the volatility of stock price index (2007) Journal of Expert Systems with Applications, 33, pp. 916-922; Ravichandran, K.S., Thirunavukarasu, P., Nallaswamy, R., Babu, R., Estimation of return on investment in share market through ANN (2005) Journal of Theoretical and Applied Information Technology, pp. 44-54; Assaf, N.A., (2011) Mercado Financeiro, , (10th ed.)

As price prediction in finance has long been a challenging task due to volume and speed of the data, investors are always looking for good algorithm to know the future price. The various machine learning algorithms (MLR, SVM, Random Forest etc.) used to predict and make further decision on stock market. The errors of predicted prices may be minimized, if the labeled dataset is mined in a efficient way. As the technical analysis always plays a major role to put profit in a investors pocket, a very simple algorithm is proposed for short term closing price prediction after analyzing similar types of movements of last few days prices to the historical data of that stock. A novel approach using Correlation Coefficients, Euclidian Distance and machine learning techniques is proposed to forecast a meaningful price based on the SBI data, fetched from the Yahoo Finance. © BEIESP.","Data Mining; Multiple Linear Regression; Random Forest; Short term stock prediction; Technical analysis",,,,,,,,"Gelman, J.H.A., (2006) Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models; Bhuriya, D., Kaushal, G., Ashish Sharma, and Upendra Singh (2017) Stock Market Predication Using a Linear Regression, 4, pp. 510-513; Dash, R., Dash, P.K., A hybrid stock trading framework integrating technical analysis with machine learning techniques (2016) The Journal of Finance and Data Science, 2 (3); Gupta, S.C., Kapoor, V.K., Fundamental of Mathematical Statistics; Han, J.P.J., Kamber, M., (2012) Data Mining Concepts and Techniques; Hurwitz, J., Kirsch, D., (2018) Machine Learning for Dummies; Karhunen, M., Algorithmic sign prediction and covariate selection across eleven international stock markets (2018) Expert Systems with Applications, 115 (7); Long, W., Zhichen, L., Cui, L., Deep learning-based feature engineering for stock price movement prediction (2018) Knowledge-Based Systems, 164 (11); Louppe, G., (2014) Understanding Random Forests: From Theory to Practice, 10. , PhD thesis; Hiransha, M., Gopalakrishnan, E.A., Menon, V., Kp, S., Nse stock market prediction using deep-learning models (2018) Procedia Computer Science, 132, pp. 1351-1362. , 01; Nse stock market prediction using deep-learning models (2018) Procedia Computer Science, 132 (1), pp. 1351-1362; Piatetsky-Shapiro, G., Uthurusamy, U.F.R., Smyth, P., (1996) Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining; Shalev-Shwartz, S.B.-D.S., (2014) Understanding Machine Learning: From Theory to Algorithms; Yunjia Zhang, X.Z., Yuntao Yao, S.W., Fang, B., Yu, P., Improving stock market prediction via heterogeneous information fusion Knowledge-Based Systems, 12, p. 2017",,,,"Blue Eyes Intelligence Engineering and Sciences Publication",,,,,22773878,,,,"English","Int.

However, compared with carbon (C) stock, little is known about the size and spatial distribution of permafrost N stock. By combining measurements from 519 pedons with two machine learning models (supporting vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF)), we estimated the size and spatial distribution of N stock across the Tibetan alpine permafrost region. We then compared these spatially-explicit N estimates with simulated N stocks from the Community Land Model (CLM). We found that N density (N amount per area) in the top three meters was 1.58 kg N m−2 (interquartile range: 1.40–1.76) across the study area, constituting a total of 1802 Tg N (interquartile range: 1605–2008), decreasing from the southeast to the northwest of the plateau. N stored below 1 m accounted for 48% of the total N stock in the top three meters. CLM4.5 significantly underestimated the N stock on the Tibetan Plateau, primarily in areas with arid/semi-arid climate. The process of biological N fixation played a key role in the underestimation of N stock prediction. Overall, our study highlights that it is imperative to improve the simulation of N processes and permafrost N stocks in land models to better predict ecological consequences induced by rapid and widespread permafrost degradation. © 2018","Climate warming; Community Land Model; Machine learning; Nitrogen cycle; Permafrost; Tibetan Plateau","Artificial intelligence; Climate models; Decision trees; Ecology; Forestry; Learning systems; Nitrogen; Spatial distribution; Climate warming; Community land models; Ecological consequences; Inter quartile ranges; Nitrogen cycles; Permafrost degradation; Supporting vector machine; Tibetan Plateau; Permafrost; nitrogen; rain; alpine environment; global warming; machine learning; nitrogen cycle; numerical model; permafrost; soil nitrogen; spatial distribution; support vector machine; Article; environmental temperature; machine learning; nitrogen fixation; permafrost; prediction; priority journal; random forest; remote sensing; semiarid climate; simulation; soil analysis; soil chemistry; support vector machine; Tibet; vegetation; China; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau",,"nitrogen, 7727-37-9",,,"National Key Clinical Specialty Discipline Construction Program of China: 2017YFA0604603, XDA19070303

In this research, we create a novel framework for stock prediction, Dynamic Advisor-Based Ensemble (dynABE). dynABE explores domain-specific areas based on the companies of interest, diversifies the feature set by creating different “advisors” that each handles a different area, follows an effective model ensemble procedure for each advisor, and combines the advisors together in a second-level ensemble through an online update strategy we developed. dynABE is able to adapt to price pattern changes of the market during the active trading period robustly, without needing to retrain the entire model. We test dynABE on three cobalt-related companies, and it achieves the best-case misclassification error of 31.12% and an annualized absolute return of 359.55% with zero maximum drawdown. dynABE also consistently outperforms the baseline models of support vector machine, neural network, and random forest in all case studies. © 2019 Zhengyang Dong.

Most prediction techniques concentrate on forecasting the future prices of stocks based on conventional Machine learning techniques. However, these techniques cannot capture long term dependencies in stock price data. Therefore, they cannot consider the relation between the current predicted data and the previous data in stock data. This research adopts deep learning techniques for predicting buy and sell recommendations in Stock Exchange of Thailand using Long Short-Term Memory. The proposed model can capture long term dependencies in stock price data in order to enhance the prediction accuracy.

Previous work in this field investigates how the true sentiment of text (i.e., positive or negative opinions) can be used for financial predictions, based on the assumption that sentiments expressed online are representative of the true market sentiment. Here we consider the converse idea, that using the stock price as the ground-truth in the system may be a better indication of sentiment. Tweets are labelled as Buy or Sell dependent on whether the stock price discussed rose or fell over the following hour, and from this, stock-specific dictionaries are built for individual companies. A Bayesian classifier is used to generate stock predictions, which are input to an automated trading algorithm. Placing 468 trades over a 1 month period yields a return rate of 5.18%, which annualises to approximately 83% per annum. This approach performs significantly better than random chance and outperforms two baseline sentiment analysis methods tested. © 2018 IEEE.","Automated Trading; Financial Engineering; Financial Markets; Machine Learning; Sentiment Analysis","Artificial intelligence; Commerce; Costs; Data mining; Financial markets; Forecasting; Learning systems; Sentiment analysis; Automated trading; Bayesian classifier; Financial engineering; Financial prediction; Ground truth; Large volumes; Social media datum; Stock predictions; Electronic trading",,,,,,,"Birbeck, E., (2017) Turning Tweets into Trades: Sentiment Analysis for Directional Stock Price Predictions, , Master's Thesis, Dept.

Embedded in these big data are useful information and knowledge that can be discovered by machine learning and data mining models, techniques or algorithms. A rich source of big data is stock exchange. The ability to effectively predict future stock prices improves the economic growth and development of a country. Traditional linear approaches for prediction (e.g., Kalman filters) may not be practical in handling big data like stock prices due to highly nonlinear and chaotic nature. This lead to the exploitation of various nonlinear estimators such as the extended Kalman filters, expert systems, and various neural network architectures. Moreover, to lessen the potential shortcomings of individual algorithms, ensemble approaches have been created by averaging values across different algorithms. Existing ensemble techniques mostly basket-together a collection of sample-based algorithms that are catered to nonlinear functions. To the best of our knowledge, traditional linear estimators have not yet been incorporated into such an ensemble. Hence, in this paper, we propose a machine learning (specifically, token-based ensemble) algorithm that utilizes both linear and nonlinear estimators to predict big financial time-series data. Our ensemble consists of a traditional Kalman filter, long short-term memory (LSTM) network, and the traditional linear regression model. We also explore the adaptive properties in short-term high-risk trading in the presence of noisy data like stock prices and demonstrate the performance of our ensemble. © 2018 IEEE.","Ensemble learning; Kalman filter; Linear data; Linear regression; Long short term memory (LSTM); Nonlinear data; Stock prediction; Time-series analysis","Big data; Brain; Costs; Data mining; Economics; Electronic trading; Expert systems; Filtration; Financial markets; Forecasting; Kalman filters; Learning algorithms; Linear regression; Long short-term memory; Network architecture; Predictive analytics; Regression analysis; Time series analysis; Ensemble learning; Linear data; Linear regression models; Machine learning approaches; Nonlinear data; Stock predictions; Technological advancement; Traditional Kalman filters; Machine learning",,,,,"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

Predicting stock price direction, especially short-term direction, is very challenging and consistently attracts researches. Deep recurrent neural networks, such as Long Short-Term Memory, typically outperform statistical time series models and traditional machine learning approaches with their mechanisms of learning to vectorize historical information. However, encoding entire history into a vector may unavoidably causes information loss regardless of memory learning and updating mechanisms, especially for those tasks where decisions need to be made on the current time point and similar historical time points are of great references to the decision making. In this paper, we propose a new deep architecture called Recurrent Embedding Kernel (REK) that can learn to make optimal decisions by referring to the entire history instead of just current memory vectors. Experimental results on multiple stock ETFs with different long-term trends show that REK outperforms RNN, LSTM, and GRU, on predicting daily price direction. © 2018 IEEE.","deep learning; recurrent architecture; recurrent embedding kernel; stock prediction; time series","Big data; Decision making; Deep learning; Embeddings; Financial markets; Forecasting; Memory architecture; Network architecture; Time series; Deep architectures; Historical information; Machine learning approaches; Optimal decisions; recurrent embedding kernel; Stock predictions; Stock price movements; Time series models; Long short-term memory",,,,,,,"Adhikari, R., Agrawal, R., A combination of artificial neural network and random walk models for financial time series forecasting (2014) Neural Computing and Applications, 24 (6), pp. 1441-1449; Liew, J.K.-S., Mayster, B., (2017) Forecasting Etfs with Machine Learning Algorithms; Qian, X.-Y., (2017) Financial Series Prediction: Comparison between Precision of Time Series Models and Machine Learning Methods, , arXiv preprint arXiv:1706 00948; Fischer, T., Krauss, C., Deep learning with long short-term memory networks for financial market predictions (2018) European Journal of Operational Research, 270 (2), pp. 654-669; Fičura, M., (2017) Forecasting Foreign Exchange Rate Movements with Knearest-neighbour, Ridge Regression and Feed-forward Neural Networks; Nelson, D.M., Pereira, A.C., De Oliveira, R.A., Stock market�s price movement prediction with lstm neural networks Neural Networks (IJCNN 2017 International Joint Conference on, 2017, pp. 1419-1426. , IEEE; Shen, G., Tan, Q., Zhang, H., Zeng, P., Xu, J., Deep learning with gated recurrent unit networks for financial sequence predictions (2018) Procedia Computer Science, 131, pp. 895-903; Hamilton, J.D., (1994) Time Series Analysis.

The accurate and reliable prediction results yield high financial benefits to common investors, brokers and speculators. The complex, evolutionary and non linear dynamic behavior of stock market makes it difficult to predict the stock market price. Hence even small improvement in prediction work can be very profitable. Fundamental analysis, technical analysis, time series analysis and statistical analysis are all used for stock prediction but none of these methods are well tried as an acceptable prediction tool. However, there is a need to find adequate methods to predict stock prices. Machine learning techniques have been now popular in predicting stock prices. Technical indicators are effective tools used to predict the trend of stock prices and are considered as good predictive features to machine learning models. The purpose of this paper is to predict the stock prices using Machine Learning Algorithms.

Although much research has been conducted in the field, the results often are not reproducible. That is the reason why the proposed workflow is publicly available on GitHub [1] as a continuous effort to help improve the research in the field. This study explores in detail the importance of financial time series technical indicators. Exploring new approaches and technical indicators, targets, feature selection techniques, and machine learning algorithms. Using data from multiple assets and periods, the proposed model adapts to market patterns to predict the future and using multiple supervised learning algorithms to ensure the adoption of different markets. The lack of research focusing on feature importance and the premise that technical indicators can improve prediction accuracy directed this research. The proposed approach highest accuracy reaches 75% with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.82, using historical data up to 2019 to ensure the applicability for today’s market, with more than a hundred experiments on a diverse set of assets publicly available. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Adaptive stock prediction; Feature selection; Machine learning; Stock price prediction; Technical indicators feature importance","Commerce; Electronic trading; Feature extraction; Financial markets; Forecasting; Learning systems; Machine learning; Time series; Adaptive machine learning; Area under the curves; Financial time series; Selection techniques; Stock market prediction; Stock predictions; Stock price prediction; Technical indicator; Learning algorithms",,,,,,,"Taha, A., Feature Importance for Ml Stock Prediction, , https://github.com/ahmedengu/feature_importance; Fama, E.F., Random walks in stock market prices (1995) Financ.

But it is crucial for the investors to predict stock market price to generate notable profit. The ultimate aim of this project is to predict the behavior of Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE). We have taken into factors such as Commodity Prices (crude oil, gold, silver), Market History, and Foreign exchange rate (FEX) that influence the stock trend, as input attributes for various machine learning models to predict the behavior of Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE). The performances of the models are then compared against other benchmarks. A structured relationship was also determined among the different attributes used. The gold price attribute was found to have the highest positive correlation with market performance.

These demands and supply are reflected in stock prices. The stock prices may be predicted using technical indicators. Most of the existing literature considered the limited technical indicators to measure short-term prices. We have considered 33 different combinations of technical indicators to predict the stock prices. The paper has two objectives, first is the technical indicator feature selection and identification of the relevant technical indicators by using Boruta feature selection technique. The second objective is an accurate prediction model for stocks. To predict stock prices we have proposed ANN (Artificial Neural Network) Regression prediction model and model performance is evaluated using metrics is Mean absolute error (MAE) and Root mean square error (RMSE). The experimental results are better than the existing method by decreasing the error rate in the prediction to 12%.

For instance, it has been widely used in financial areas such as stock market prediction, portfolio optimization, financial information processing and trade execution strategies. Stock market prediction is one of the most popular and valuable area in finance. In this paper, we propose a novel architecture of Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) with the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) as the discriminator and the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) as the generator for forecasting the closing price of stocks. The generator is built by LSTM to mine the data distributions of stocks from given data in stock market and generate data in the same distributions, whereas the discriminator designed by MLP aims to discriminate the real stock data and generated data. We choose the daily data on S&P 500 Index and several stocks in a wide range of trading days and try to predict the daily closing price. Experimental results show that our novel GAN can get a promising performance in the closing price prediction on the real data compared with other models in machine learning and deep learning. © 2019 The Author(s).","Data Mining; Deep Learning; Generative Adversarial Networks; Stock Prediction","Commerce; Data mining; Deep learning; Financial data processing; Financial markets; Forecasting; Internet of things; Adversarial networks; Data distribution; Multi layer perceptron; Novel architecture; Portfolio optimization; Price prediction; Stock market prediction; Stock predictions; Long short-term memory",,,,,"17-3-3-20-nsh

The key novelty is that we propose to employ adversarial training to improve the generalization of a neural network prediction model. The rationality of adversarial training here is that the input features to stock prediction are typically based on stock price, which is essentially a stochastic variable and continuously changed with time by nature. As such, normal training with static price-based features (e.g., the close price) can easily overfit the data, being insufficient to obtain reliable models. To address this problem, we propose to add perturbations to simulate the stochasticity of price variable, and train the model to work well under small yet intentional perturbations. Extensive experiments on two real-world stock data show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art solution [Xu and Cohen, 2018] with 3.11% relative improvements on average w.r.t. accuracy, validating the usefulness of adversarial training for stock prediction task. © 2019 International Joint Conferences on Artificial Intelligence.

However, notion of stock price predictability is typical, many researchers suggest that the prices are predictable and investor can make above-average profits using efficient Technical Analysis (TA). Most of the earlier prediction models predict individual stocks and the results are mostly influenced by company’s reputation, news, sentiments and other fundamental issues while stock indices are less affected by these issues. In this work, an effort is made to predict the prices of stock indices by utilizing Stock Technical Indicators (STIs) which in turn helps to take buy-sell decision over long and short term. Two different models are built, one for future price trend prediction of indices and other for taking Buy-Sell decision at the end of day. As a part of prediction model the optimized Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model is combined with highly correlated STIs. The models are implemented in Python language using popular deep learning libraries TensorFlow and Keras. The experiments are carried out with three popular indices of National Stock Exchange (NSE) of India: Bank, Automobile and Metal. The concept of applying adaptive TA on stock indices along with Optimized-LSTM is demonstrated successfully in this work. The price trend prediction model presents monthly trend correctly and indicates nature of indices over long term, i.e. Profit, Loss and Neutral. The daily prediction model observed up to 68.45% accuracy and average accuracy of 61.51%. © 2019, Research Trend.

Quantitative trading applies a wide range of computational approaches such as statistics, physics, or machine learning to analyze, predict, and take advantage of big data in finance for investment. This work studies core components of a quantitative trading system. Machine learning offers a number of important advantages over traditional algorithmic trading. With machine learning, multiple trading strategies are implemented consistently and able to adapt to real-time market. To demonstrate how machine learning techniques can meet quantitative trading, linear regression and support vector regression models are used to predict stock movement. In addition, multiple optimization techniques are used to optimize the return and control risk in trading. One common characteristic for both prediction models is they effectively performed in short-term prediction with high accuracy and return. However, in short-term prediction, the linear regression model is outperform compared to the support vector regression model. The prediction accuracy is considerably improved by adding technical indicators to dataset rather than adjusted price and volume. Despite the gap between prediction modeling and actual trading, the proposed trading strategy achieved a higher return than the S&P 500 ETF-SPY. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.","Machine learning; Portfolio optimization; Quantitative trading; Stock prediction; Trading strategy","Artificial intelligence; Commerce; Forecasting; Investments; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Regression analysis; Automated trading systems; Linear regression models; Machine learning techniques; Portfolio optimization; Quantitative trading; Stock predictions; Support vector regression models; Trading strategies; Electronic trading",,,,,,,"Huang, W., Nakamori, Y., Wang, S.Y., (2005) Forecasting Stock Market Movement Direction with Support Vector Machine, 32 (10), pp. 2513-2522; Chong, E., Han, C., Park, F.C., (2017) Deep Learning Networks for Stock Market Analysis and Prediction: Methodology, Data Representations, and Case Studies, 83, pp. 187-205; Narang, R.K., (2009) Inside The Black Box: The Simple Truth About Quantitative Trading, , Wiley Finance Press, New Jersey, Chapter 1; Chan, E., (2008) Quantitative Trading: How to Build Your Own Algorithmic Trading Business (1 st ed.), , Wiley Press, Chapter 3; Treleaven, P., Galas, M., Lalchand, V., (2013) Algorithmic Trading Review, 56 (11), pp. 76-85; Russell, S., Norvig, P., (2009) Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach (3 rd ed.), , Pearson Press.

However, in the early time, because of some reasons and the limitation of the device, only a few people had the access to the study. Thanks to the rapid development of science and technology, in recent years more and more people are devoted to the study of the prediction and it becomes easier and easier for us to make stock prediction by using different ways now, including machine learning, deep learning and so on. In this paper, we proposed a deep learning method based on Convolutional Neural Network to predict the stock price movement of Chinese stock market. We set the opening price, high price, low price, closing price and volume of stock deriving from the internet as input of the architecture and then run and test the program. The result has shown that it is a bit reliable to use deep learning method based on Convolutional Neural Network to predict the stockprice movement of China. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Convolution; Electronic trading; Financial markets; Forecasting; Neural networks; Software testing; Chinese stock market; Convolutional neural network; Development of science and technologies; High price; Hot topics; Learning methods; Stock predictions; Stock price movements; Deep learning",,,,,,,"Chen, J.F., Chen, W.L., Huang, C.P., Huang, S.H., Chen, A.P., (2016) 2016 7th International Conference on Cloud Computing and Big Data (CCBD), pp. 87-92. , (Macau) Financial Time-Series Data Analysis Using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks; Cao, L.J., Tay, F.E.H., Support vector machine with adaptive parameters in financial time series forecasting (2003) IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks, 14 (6), pp. 1506-1518. , Nov; Kercheval Alec, N., Zhang, Y., Modelling high-frequency limit order book dynamics with support vector machines Quantitative Finance, 15, pp. 1-15; Abhishek, K., Khairwa, A., Pratap, T., Prakash, S., (2012) Computing Communication &networking Technologies (ICCCNT), 2012 Third International Conference on, pp. 1-5. , (Coimbatore) A stock market prediction model using Artificial Neural Network; Yuzheng, Z., Hsu, A., Halgamuge, S.K., (2007) International Symposium on Neural Networks: Advances in Neural Networks, pp. 1087-1096. , (Springer-Verlag) Combining News and Technical Indicators in Daily Stock Price Trends Prediction; Ruiz Eduardo, J., (2012) Correlating Financial Time Series with Micro-blogging Activity, pp. 513-522. , (ACM); Armano, G., Marchesi, M., Murru, A., A hybrid genetic-neural architecture for stock indexes forecasting Information Sciences, 1701, pp. 3-33; Kelvin, X., Show, Attend and Tell: Neural Image Caption Generation with Visual Attention (2015) Computer Science, pp. 2048-2057; Tsantekidis, A., Passalis, N., Tefas, A., Kanniainen, J., Gabbouj, M., Iosifidis, A., (2017) 2017 IEEE 19th Conference on Business Informatics (CBI), pp. 7-12. , (Thessaloniki) Forecasting Stock Prices from the Limit Order Book Using Convolutional Neural Networks; Yoon, K., Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification (2014) EprintArxiv; Xiang, Z., Lecun, Y., Text Understanding from Scratch (2015) Computer Science; Nal, K., Grefenstette, E., Blunsom, P., A Convolutional Neural Network for Modelling Sentences EprintArxiv, 1; Ronan, C., Weston, J., (2008) International Conference on Machine Learning, pp. 160-167. , (ACM) A unified architecture for natural language processing: deep neural networks with multitask learning; Tomas, M., (2010) INTERSPEECH 2010, Conference of the International Speech Communication Association, Makuhari, Chiba, Japan, September, pp. 1045-1048. , (DBLP) Recurrent neural network based language model; Ozan, I., Cardie, C., Opinion Mining with Deep Recurrent Neural Networks (2014) Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pp. 720-728; Saad, E.W., Prokhorov, D.V., Wunsch, D.C., Comparative study of stock trend prediction using time delay, recurrent and probabilistic neural networks IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks, 96, pp. 1456-1470; Akhter Mohiuddin, R., Agarwal, A., Sastry, V.N., Recurrent neural network and a hybrid model for prediction of stock returns Expert Systems with Applications, 426, pp. 3234-3241; Kai, C., Zhou, Y., Dai, F., (2015) IEEE International Conference on Big Data, pp. 2823-2824. , (IEEE) A LSTM-based method for stock returns prediction: A case study of China stock market; Nelson David, M.Q., Pereira, A.C.M., Oliveira, R.A.D., (2017) International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, pp. 1419-1426. , (IEEE) Stock market's price movement prediction with LSTM neural networks; Raj, A., Gupta, S., Verma, N.K., (2016) 2016 11th International Conference on Industrial and Information Systems (ICIIS), pp. 54-59. , (Roorkee, India) Face detection and recognition based on skin segmentation and CNN; Farooq, A., Anwar, S., Awais, M., Rehman, S., (2017) 2017 IEEE International Conference on Imaging Systems and Techniques (IST), pp. 1-6. , (Beijing) A deep CNN based multi-class classification of Alzheimer's disease using MRI; Chen, K., Zhou, Y., Dai, F., (2015) 2015 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data), pp. 2823-2824. , (Santa Clara, CA) A LSTM-based method for stock returns prediction: A case study of China stock market; Maas, A.L., Hannun, A.Y., Ng, A.Y., Rectifier nonlinearities improve neural network acoustic models (2013) ICML",,,"Donghua University","Institute of Physics Publishing","2018 2nd International Conference on Artificial Intelligence Applications and Technologies, AIAAT 2018","8 August 2018 through 10 August 2018",,142232,17578981,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

These models are based on five supervised learning techniques i.e., Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Naive Bayes, and Softmax. The experimental results show that Random Forest algorithm performs the best for large datasets and Naive Bayesian Classifier is the best for small datasets.

In the financial market, the advancements in computational field have been mainly achieved through the use of neural networks and machine learning tools that delivered a number of financial applications. These applications include: stock market prediction, bankruptcy prediction, risk assessment etc. Thus, in this paper, we are developing a technique to predict the stock market index for the “Dow Jones” using deep learning algorithms. We propose a model based on an adaptive NARX neural network that can predict the closing price of a moderately stable market. In our model, non-linear auto regressive exogenous input model inserts delays into the input as well as the output acting as memory slots thereby raising the accuracy of the prediction. This model uses a time series analysis to improve the prediction accuracy. In addition, Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm has been used for training the network. The accuracy of the model is determined by the mean squared error between the predicted and the actual prices. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.","Artificial intelligence; Deep learning; Financial forecasting; NARX algorithm; Stock prediction","Artificial intelligence; Big data; Commerce; Deep learning; Electronic trading; Financial markets; Forecasting; Mean square error; Risk assessment; Time series analysis; Auto-regressive exogenous inputs; Bankruptcy prediction; Computational technology; Financial applications; Financial forecasting; Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm; Stock market prediction; Stock predictions; Learning algorithms",,,,,,,"Thakur, A., Tiwari, A., Kumar, S., Jain, A., Singh, J., NARX Based Forecasting of Petrol Prices (2016) 5th International Conference on Reliability, Infocom Technologies and Optimization (ICRITO) (Trends and Future Directions), pp. 610-614; Graham, B., Dodd, D., Buffett, W., (2009) Security Analysis, , New York: McGraw-Hill; Reinkensmeyer, B., (2011) StockTrader.Com, , https://www.stocktrader.com/, Jun 16th, Retrieved December 27, 2017, from; Devi, B.U., Sundar, D., Alli, P., An optimized approach to predict the stock market behavior and investment decision making using benchmark algorithms for Naïve investors (2013) 2013 IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Computing Research; Dunis, C., Williams, M., Modeling and Trading the EUR/USD Exchange Rate: Do Neural Network Models Perform Better?

Recent studies on using text contents of information reporting platforms has opened up new ways of analyzing the stock market with machine learning. we propose using the Securities and Exchange Committee (SEC) mandated 10-Q form as a possible source of data for stock predictions. Using the 10-Q reports of SP 500 companies, we create our corpus by extracting bag-of-words (BOW) of any additions made to the 10-Q documents. Then, we create feed-forward multilayer neural network on stock price ratios of different target prediction periods and achieve positive prediction rates. We demonstrate that text contents of 10-Q form may have information value to stock price prediction models. © 2018 IEEE.","Multi-layer neural network; Natural Language; Stock Markets","Commerce; Costs; Electronic trading; Forecasting; Learning systems; Multilayer neural networks; Network layers; Software engineering; Information reporting; Information value; Natural languages; Prediction rate; Stock market prediction; Stock predictions; Stock price prediction; Target prediction; Financial markets",,,,,"Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP

These studies attempted to extract input features mostly from the price information with little focus on the trading volume information. In addition, modeling parameters to specify a learning problem have not been intensively investigated. We herein develop an improved method by handling those limitations. Specifically, we generated input variables by considering both price and volume information with even weight. We also defined three modeling parameters: the input and the target window sizes and the profit threshold. These specify the input and target variables, between which the underlying functions are learned by multilayer perceptrons and support vector machines. We tested our approach over six stocks and 15 years and compared with the expected performance over all considered parameter specifications. Our approach dramatically improved the prediction accuracy over the expected performance. In addition, our approach was shown to be stably more profitable than both the expected performance and the buy-and-hold strategy. On the other hand, the performance was degraded when the input variables generated from the trading volume were excluded from learning. All these results validate the importance of the volume and the modeling parameters in stock trading prediction. © 2018 by the authors.","Daily stock prediction; Model parameters; Multilayer perceptrons; Support vector machines; Trading volume",,,,,,"National IT Industry Promotion Agency, NIPA

Predictions can be performed by mainly two means, one by using previous data available against the stock and the other by analysing the social media information. Predictions based on previous data lack accuracy due to changing patterns in the stock market al.so, some fields might have been missed due to their insignificance in some stocks or unavailability of data. For example, some models may require 'return rate' as a parameter for stock prediction, but the available data might not have it. On the other hand, a model predicting only on the basis of the return rate may find opening and closing price to be insignificant parameters. The data has to be cleansed before it can be used for predictions. This paper focuses on categorising various methods used for predictive analytics in different domains to date, their shortcomings. Further, the authors of this paper have suggested some improvements that could be incorporated to achieve better accuracy in these approaches. © 2018 IEEE.","Data Analysis; Linear Regression.; Machine Learning; Predictive Analysis; Stock Prediction","Commerce; Data reduction; Electronic trading; Financial markets; Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Linear regression; Predictive analytics; Area of interest; Computer engineers; Different domains; Social media informations; Stock market prediction; Stock predictions; Machine learning",,,,,,,"Bhuriya, D., Kaushal, G., Sharma, A., Singh, U., Stock market predication using a linear regression (2017) International Conference on Electronics, Communication and Aerospace Technology; Guo, P., Waqar, M., Dawood, H., Shahnawaz, M.B., Ghazanfar, M.A., Prediction of stock market by principle component analysis (2017) 13th International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Security; Hu, Z., Zhu, J., Tse, K., Stocks market prediction using support vector machine (2013) 6th International Conference on Information Management, Innovation Management and Industrial Engineering; Kavitha, S., Varuna, S., Ramya, R., A comparative analysis on linear regression and support vector regression (2016) Online International Conference on Green Engineering and Technologies (IC-GET); Sharma, A., Bhuriya, D., Singh, U., Survey of stock market prediction using machine learning approach (2017) International Conference on Electronics, Communication and Aerospace Technology; Verma, R., Choure, P., Singh, U., Neural networks through stock market data prediction (2017) International Conference on Electronics, Communication and Aerospace Technology; Zhao, L., Wang, L., Price trend prediction of stock market using outlier data mining algorithm (2015) IEEE Fifth International Conference on Big Data and Cloud Computing; Balaji, S.N., Paul, P.V., Saravanan, R., Survey on sentiment analysis based stock prediction using big data analytics (2017) International Conference on Innovations in Power and Advanced Computing Technologies; Kumar, P., Bala, A., Intelligent stock data prediction using (2016) International Conference on Inventive Computation Technologies (ICICT), , Coimbatore, India; Rajput, V., Bobde, S., Stock market prediction using hybrid approach (2016) International Conference on Computing, Communication and Automation (ICCCA2016); Tiwari, S., Bharadwaj, A., Gupta, S., Stock price prediction using data analytics (2017) International Conference on Advances in Computing, , Communication and Control (ICAC3), Mumbai, India; Attigeri, G.V., Pai, M.P.M.M.R.M., Nayak, A., Stock market prediction: A big data approach (2015) TENCON 2015-2015 IEEE Region 10 Conference, , Macao, China; https://in.finance.yahoo.com, ""Yahoo Finance.

Sentiment Analysis can be used to predict the mood of people that have impact on stock prices, therefore it can help in prediction of actual stock movement. In order to exploit the benefits of sentiment analysis in stock market industry we have performed sentiment analysis on tweets related to Apple products, which are extracted from StockTwits (a social networking site) from 2010 to 2017. Along with tweets, we have also used market index data which is extracted from Yahoo Finance for the same period. The sentiment score of a tweet is calculated by sentiment analysis of tweets through SVM. As a result each tweet is categorized as bullish or bearish. Then sentiment score and market data is used to build a SVM model to predict next day's stock movement. Results show that there is positive relation between people opinion and market data and proposed work has an accuracy of 76.65% in stock prediction. © 2018 IEEE.","Machine Learning; NLP; Opinion Mining; Sentiment Analysis; Stock Prediction; StockTwits","Artificial intelligence; Commerce; Data mining; Financial markets; Forecasting; Learning systems; Market data; Sentiment scores; Social networking sites; Stock movement; Stock predictions; Stock price movements; StockTwits; Text segments; Sentiment analysis",,,,,,,"Fama, E.F., The behavior of stock-market prices (1965) The Journal of Business, pp. 34-105; Cootner, P.H., The random character of stock market The Journal of Business; Fama, E.F., Random walks in stock market prices Financial Analysts Journal; Fama, E.F., Fisher, L., Jensen, M.C., Roll, R., The adjustment of stock prices to new information International Economic Review; Bollen, J., Mao, H., Zeng, X., Twitter mood predicts the stock market (2011) Journal of Computational Science; Malcolm Baker, J.W., (2006) Investor Sentiment and the Cross-Section of Stock Returns; Megahed, F.M., Farmer, J., (2015) Frontiers in Statistical Quality Control, 11; Kordonis, J., Stock price forecasting via sentiment analysis on twitter (2016) The 20th Panhellenic Conference on Informatics (PCI '16), Greece; Dang, M., Improvement Methods for stock market prediction using financial news articles (2016) Information and Computer Science (NICS) 2016 3rd National Foundation for Science and Technology Development Conference, Danang, Vietnam; Sun, A., Trade the tweet: Social media text mining and sparse matrix factorization for stock market prediction (2016) International Review of Financial Analysis, pp. 272-281; Meesad, P., Stock trend prediction relying on text mining and sentiment analysis with tweets (2014) Information and Communication Technologies (WICT) 2014, Bandar Hilir, Malaysia; Wenga, B., Ahmed, M.A., Megahedbc, F.M., Stock market one-day ahead movement prediction using disparate data sources (2017) Expert Systems with Applications, pp. 153-163; Smailovi, J., Grar, M., Lavra, N., Žnidarši, M., Predictive sentiment analysis of tweets: A stock market application (2013) Human-Computer Interaction and Knowledge Discovery in Complex, Unstructured, Big Data, pp. 77-88. , Verlag Berlin Heidelberg, Springer; Rao, T., Srivastava, S., Analyzing stock market movements using twitter sentiment analysis (2012) International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining; Gilbert, E., Karahalios, K., Widespread worry and the stock market (2010) Artifical Intelligence; Zhang, X., Fuehres, H., Gloor, P.A., (2009) Predicting Stock Market Indicators Through Twitter",,,"Cheninn;HEC;NBP","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","2018 International Conference on Computing, Mathematics and Engineering Technologies, iCoMET 2018","3 March 2018 through 4 March 2018",,136152,,9781538613702,,,"English","Int.

Some machine learning algorithms, such as linear fitting and sequence mining, are employed to predict the stock market. However, linear fitting faces issue of over-fitting and black relationships with historical data, while sequence mining is short in efficiency and lack dynamic adaptations. This paper builds a modified Bayesian-LSTM (B-LSTM) model for stock prediction. Six indicators of the Chinese stock market in every day are the basic input for LSTM. In order to represent the economic wave, we defined a data set unit by week which means the basic unit in LSTM is data in one week. Furthermore, a Bayesian optimization model is proposed to estimate the unit number dynamically in different economic cycle. The experimental results demonstrated that the B-LSTM increase over 25% prediction than the conventional LSTM. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.","B-LSTM; Bayesian optimization; Data set unit; Stock market; Stock prediction","Commerce; Data mining; Financial markets; Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Bayesian optimization; Chinese stock market; Data set; Dynamic adaptations; Economic cycles; Historical data; Sequence mining; Stock predictions; Long short-term memory",,,,,"2017A10

Among all social media, with its popular micro-blogging service, Twitter enables users to share short messages in real time about events or express their own opinions. In this paper, we examine the effectiveness of various machine learning techniques on retrieved tweet corpus. A machine learning model is deployed to predict tweet sentiment, as well as gain an insight into the correlation between twitter sentiment and stock prices. Specifically, that correlation is acquired by mining tweets using Twitter's search API and process it for further analysis. To determine tweet sentiment, two types of machine learning techniques are adopted including Naïve Bayes classification and Support vector machines. By evaluating each model, we discover that support vector machine gives higher accuracy through cross validation. After predicting tweet sentiment, we mine historical stock data using Yahoo finance API, while the designed feature matrix for stock market prediction includes positive, negative, neutral and total sentiment score and stock price for each day.

Existing studies on stock market trend prediction have introduced machine learning methods with handcrafted features. However, manual labor spent on handcrafting features is expensive. To reduce manual labor, we propose a novel recurrent convolutional neural network for predicting stock market trend. Our network can automatically capture useful information from news on stock market without any handcrafted feature. In our network, we first introduce an entity embedding layer to automatically learn entity embedding using financial news. We then use a convolutional layer to extract key information affecting stock market trend, and use a long short-term memory neural network to learn context-dependent relations in financial news for stock market trend prediction. Experimental results show that our model can achieve significant improvement in terms of both overall prediction and individual stock predictions, compared with the state-of-the-art baseline methods. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.","Convolutional neural network; Embedding layer; Long short-term memory; Stock market prediction","Brain; Commerce; Convolution; Electronic trading; Financial markets; Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Long short-term memory; Natural language processing systems; Network layers; Context-dependent relation; Convolutional neural network; Embedding layer; High-frequency trading; Machine learning methods; Short term prediction; Stock market prediction; Stock predictions; Investments",,,,,"Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education of China, SRFDP: 20090041110002

Therefore, research on stock prediction is becoming a hot area. In this paper, we propose to incorporate a joint model using the TransE model for representation learning and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which extracts features from financial news articles. This joint learning can improve the accuracy of text feature extraction while reducing the sparseness of news headlines. On the other hand, we present a joint feature extraction method which extracts feature vectors from both daily trading data and technical indicators. The approach is evaluated using Support Vector Machines (SVM) as a traditional machine learning method and Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) model as a deep learning method. The proposed model is used to predict Apple’s stock price movement using the Standard & Poor’s 500 index (S&P 500). The experiments show that the accuracy of news sentiment classification for feature selection achieved 97.66% by model of joint learning, the performance of joint learning is better than feature extraction by CNN, the accuracy of stock price movement prediction through deep learning achieved 55.44%, this result is higher than traditional machine learning. This model can give the investors greater decision support. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.","Deep learning; Event tuple; Financial news; Knowledge graph embedding; Stock market","Commerce; Decision support systems; Electronic trading; Extraction; Feature extraction; Financial markets; Forecasting; Intelligent systems; Investments; Knowledge acquisition; Knowledge management; Long short-term memory; Motion estimation; Support vector machines; Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN); Event tuple; Feature extraction methods; Financial news; Knowledge graphs; Machine learning methods; Sentiment classification; Stock price movement predictions; Deep learning",,,,,"China Scholarship Council, CSC","Acknowledgments.

Traditional stock prediction models including statistical and machine learning based methods almost use handcrafted features as input. With the development of deep learning, end-to-end models achieve state-of-the-art in many other tasks. However financial time series data is too noise to apply end-to-end models straightly, instead of predicting stocks’ absolute future return, we propose a novel stock selection model DeepStockRanker to predict stocks’ future return ranking. Experimental results show that our method is able to extract information from raw data to predict stocks’ future return ranking and achieves much better performance compared with several advanced models. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.","End-to-end; Learning to rank; LSTM; Stock selection","Big data; Deep learning; Financial data processing; Forecasting; Long short-term memory; End to end; Extract informations; Financial time series; Learning to rank; LSTM; Neural network model; Stock predictions; Stock selections; Data mining",,,,,"Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality: 4162029

However, it is not easy to make this prediction with high accuracy. Recently, plenty of combinations of statistical methods have been proposed. The main direction of these methods is that combination of regression learner (e.g., SVM) and a clustering of data (e.g., SOM). While these methods make relative success, their extensibility is still under discussion. In this paper, we propose an hybrid model of self-organized map and integrated fuzzy rules with support vector machine. The proposition method is evaluated to be a good approach to apply to stock price analysis. Moreover, this method provides interpretable rules which can be understood, calibrated, and modified by experts in order to direct the learning phase. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2018.","Fuzzy model; Machine learning; Self-organized map; Stock prediction; Support vector machine","Costs; Electronic trading; Financial markets; Forecasting; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy rules; Information systems; Information use; Support vector machines; Systems analysis; Fuzzy modeling; High-accuracy; Hybrid model; Interpretable rules; Learning phase; Self-organized map; Stock predictions; Stock price; Learning systems",,,,,,,"Cortes, C., Vapnik, V., Support-vector networks (1995) Machine Learning, 20 (3), pp. 273-297; Hsu, C.-W., Chang, C.-C., (2003) A Practical Guide to Support Vector Classification; Chiang, J.-H., Hao, P.-Y., Support vector learning mechanism for fuzzy rule-based modeling: A new approach (2004) IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems, 12 (1), pp. 1-12; Smola, A.J., Schölkopf, B., A tutorial on support vector regression (2004) Statistics and Computing, 14 (3), pp. 199-222; Schölkopf, B., Smola, A.J., Williamson, R.C., Bartlett, P.L., New support vector algorithms (2000) Neural Computation, 12 (5), pp. 1207-1245; Cao, L.-J., Tay, F.E.H., Support vector machine with adaptive parameters in financial time series forecasting (2003) IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks, 14 (6), pp. 1506-1518; Uslan, V., Seker, H., Support vector-based takagi-sugeno fuzzy system for the prediction of binding affinity of peptides, (2013) Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC), 2013 35Th Annual International Conference of the IEEE.

In particular; to perform signal processing and machine learning tasks in the encrypted domain. Homomorphic encryption offers provably secure, asymmetric encryption solution to this problem, however, it comes with a high storage and computation cost. Compressed sensing (CS) and random projection (RP) approaches are much lighter; however, they lack privacy since the encryption uses a symmetric key which is the random projection matrix. A multi-key, compressed sensing encryption approach is proposed in this paper for performing basic generic computations. The computing architecture consists of a User, a Cloud (which stores encrypted data from an Owner), and a Trusted Third Party (TTP) which is responsible for distributing the random CS keys. The TTP also trains two machine learning modules; ML1 and ML2. ML1, used at the cloud, takes as input the multi-key encrypted data and produces an intermediate encrypted result. ML2, available at the user side, decrypts the results. This novel approach is much cheaper than homomorphic encryption in terms of data expansion, storage as well as encryption time. Also, it offers the privacy of the multi-keys. The proposed approach is applied on 2 generic computing tasks; namely, squared Euclidean distance and dot product. The developed approach is tested on the COREL image classification task using the squared Euclidean distance and on an autoregressive (AR) stock prediction task using the dot product. © 2017 IEEE.","Compressed Sensing Encryption; Homomorphic Encryption; Machine Learning; Multi-Key Encryption; Privacy Preserving Computing","Artificial intelligence; Compressed sensing; Computer architecture; Data privacy; Digital storage; Information analysis; Learning systems; Signal processing; Asymmetric encryption; Compressive sensing; Computing architecture; Ho-momorphic encryptions; Multi-key encryption; Privacy preserving; Squared euclidean distance; Trusted third parties; Cryptography",,,,,,,"Inald, R., Lagendijk, L., Erkin, Z., Barni, M., Encrypted signal processing for privacy protection (2013) IEEE Signal Processing Magazine 2013, 30 (1), pp. 82-103. , Jan; Lu, W., Varna, A.L., Wu, M., Confidentiality-preserving image search a comparative study between homomorphic encryption and distance-preserving randomization (2014) IEEE Access 2, (2014), pp. 125-141; Bost, R., Popa, R.A., Tu, S., Goldwasser, S., Machine learning classification over encrypted data (2014) IACR Cryptology EPrint Archive 2014; Gilad-Bachrach, R., Dowlin, N., Laine, K., Lauter, K., Naehrig, M., Wernsing, J., Cryptonets: Applying neural networks to encrypted data with high throughput and accuracy (2016) Proceedings of the 33rd Intl.

Undoubtedly, its prediction is one of the most challenging tasks in time series forecasting. Moreover existing Artificial Neural Network (ANN) approaches fail to provide encouraging results. Meanwhile advances in machine learning have presented favourable results for speech recognition, image classification and language processing. Methods applied in digital signal processing can be applied to stock data as both are time series. Similarly, learning outcome of this paper can be applied to speech time series data. Deep learning for stock prediction has been introduced in this paper and its performance is evaluated on Google stock price multimedia data (chart) from NASDAQ. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate that deep learning can improve stock market forecasting accuracy. For this, (2D)2PCA + Deep Neural Network (DNN) method is compared with state of the art method 2-Directional 2-Dimensional Principal Component Analysis (2D)2PCA + Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN). It is found that the proposed method is performing better than the existing method RBFNN with an improved accuracy of 4.8% for Hit Rate with a window size of 20. Also the results of the proposed model are compared with the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and it is found that the accuracy for Hit Rate is improved by 15.6%. The correlation coefficient between the actual and predicted return for DNN is 17.1% more than RBFNN and it is 43.4% better than RNN. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","(2D)2PCA; Deep Learning; Multimedia; Neural Network; Radial Basis Function Neural Network; Regularization; Stock Prediction","Artificial intelligence; Commerce; Complex networks; Electronic trading; Finance; Financial markets; Forecasting; Functions; Image classification; Learning systems; Neural networks; Radial basis function networks; Recurrent neural networks; Signal processing; Speech recognition; Time series; (2D)2PCA; Deep learning; Multimedia; Radial basis function neural networks; Regularization; Stock predictions; Principal component analysis",,,,,,,"Atsalakis, G.S., Valavanis, K.P., Surveying stock market forecasting techniques--Part II: soft computing methods (2009) Expert Syst Appl, 36, pp. 5932-5941; Elman, J.L., Finding structure in time (1990) Cogn Sci, 14, pp. 179-211; Erhan, D., Bengio, Y., Courville, A., Manzagol, P.A., Vincent, P., Bengio, S., Why does unsupervised pre-training help deep learning?

Indeed, being able to make accurate forecasts has strong implications on trading strategies. Surprisingly enough little has been published, relatively to the importance of the topic. In this paper, we reviewed how well four classic classification algorithms: random forest, gradient boosted trees, artificial neural network and logistic regression perform in predicting 463 stocks of the S&P 500. Several experiments were conduced to thoroughly study the predictability of these stocks. To validate each prediction algorithm, three schemes we compared: standard cross validation, sequential validation and single validation. As expected, we were not able to predict stocks future prices from their past. However, unexpectedly, we were able to show that taking into account recent information - such as recently closed European and Asian indexes - to predict S&P 500 can lead to a vast increase in predictability. Moreover, we also found out that, among various sectors, financial sector stocks are comparatively more easy to predict than others. © 2017 IEEE.","classification; evaluation; stock prediction","Big data; Classification (of information); Decision trees; Forecasting; Machine learning; Motion estimation; Neural networks; Classification algorithm; Cross validation; evaluation; Financial sectors; Logistic regressions; Prediction algorithms; Stock predictions; Trading strategies; Electronic trading",,,,,,,"Fama, E.F., The behavior of stock-market prices (1965) The Journal of Business, 38 (1), pp. 34-105; Gidofalvi, G., Elkan, C., (2001) Using News Articles to Predict Stock Price Movements, , Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of California, San Diego; (2013) Understanding Asset Prices, , N.

First objective of this research is to optimize the stock price trend prediction for short term using some oscillators and indicators: Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), the Relative Strength Index (RSI), the Stochastic Oscillator (KDJ) and Bollinger Band (BB). It is observed that using appropriate pre-processing technique and Machine learning model, it is possible to improve accuracy rate of short-term trend prediction. Applying Preprocessing and then using combination of data can yield a better Accuracy rate in Short term Trades, while predicting for Long-term Trend of Stock this Technical indicators are not sufficient. Along with some of this Technical data and Fundamental Data of the company, it is possible to predict Long term stock movement. For Long term Prediction its Debt to Equity, Net profit of pervious 3 year, Promoters holding, Dividend yield and PE ratio is used along with Technical Factors. It is observed that using Fundamental and Technical Data, Long term Stock Prediction is Possible. © 2017 IEEE.","Bagging; Fundamental data; J48 Decision tree; KDJ; MACD; Random Forest; RSI","Commerce; Control systems; Decision trees; Financial markets; Intelligent computing; Stochastic systems; Bagging; Fundamental data; MACD; Machine learning models; Moving average convergence divergence (MACD); Random forests; Relative strength index; Stock trend prediction; Forecasting",,,,,,,"Mingyuan, W.U., Diao, X., (2015) Technical Analysis of Three Stock Oscillators Testing MACD, RSI and KDJ Rules in SH & SZ Stock Markets, 2015 4th International Conference on Computer Science and Network Technology, , ICCSNT; Boonpeng, S., Jeatrakul, P., Decision support system for investing in stock market by using oaa-neural network (2016) 8th International Conference on Advanced Computational Intelligence Chiang Mai, , Thailand; February 14-16; Chee Yong, C., Mohd Taib, S., (2009) Designing A Decision Support System Model for Stock Investment Strategy, , WCECS, October 20-22, 2009, San Francisco, USA; Hidayah, I., Adhistya Erna, P., Agustami Kristy, M., Application of j48 and bagging for classification of vertebral column pathologies (2014) 2014 International Conference on Information Technology and Multimedia (ICIMU), , November 18-20, , Putrajaya, Malaysia; Hargreaves, C., Hao, Y., Does the Use of Technical & Fundamental Analysis Improve Stock Choice? : A Data Mining Approach Applied to the Australian Stock Market; Ma, Y., (2013) The Research of Stock Predictive Model Based on the Combination of CART and DBSCAN, , Ninth International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Security; Wilder, J.W., (1978) New Concepts in Technical Trading System, , Trend Reseach; Wilder, J.W., (1978) New Concepts in Technical Trading Systems, , Trend Research; Kannan, K.S., Sekar, P.S., Sathik, M.M., Financial stock market forecast using data mining techniques[C] (2010) Proceedings of the International Multi Conference of Engineers and Computer Scientists, p. 1; Murphy, J.J., (1999) Technical Analysis of the Financial Markets: A Comprehensive Guide to Trading Methods and Applications, , Penguin; http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:bollinger_bands; Pradeep, K.R., Na, N.C., Pradeep, K.R., Naveen Veen, N.C., Predictive analysis of diabetes using J48 algorithm of classification techniques 2016 2nd International Conference on Contemporary Computing and Informatics (IC3I)","Kamble, R.A.; Computer Science and Engineering, Government College of EngineeringIndia; email: Kamblerupesh9@gmail.com",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","2017 International Conference on Intelligent Computing and Control Systems, ICICCS 2017","15 June 2017 through 16 June 2017",,134184,,9781538627457,,,"English","Proc.

Many approaches including machine learning based and statistical models have been employed to forecast price changes in stock market. Considering the power of Restricted Bolztmann Machine (RBM) for feature extraction, we propose to incorporate RBM and several classifiers to predict short-term stock market trend. In this paper, eleven technical indicators are firstly inferred by using trading data, e.g., close price, lowest price, open price and highest price. Afterwards, these technical indicators are conveyed to binary values by using a trend deterministic preparation layer. We apply a RBM to extract features from binary valued features from the last step. The experimental study demonstrates this model's effectiveness compared with several traditional methods. © 2017 IEEE.","Restricted Boltzmann Machine; Stock Market; Trend Prediction","Commerce; Costs; Finance; Forecasting; Learning systems; Binary values; Financial applications; Market trends; Price changes; Restricted boltzmann machine; Stock predictions; Technical indicator; Trend prediction; Financial markets",,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 61472021","This work was partially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 61472021), the National Department Public Benefit Research Foundation of China (No.","Boyacioglu, M.A., Avci, D., An adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) for the prediction of stock market return: The case of the istanbul stock exchange (2010) Expert Systems with Applications, 37 (12), pp. 7908-7912; Bisoi, R., Dash, P.K., A hybrid evolutionary dynamic neural network for stock market trend analysis and prediction using unscented kalman filter (2014) Applied Soft Computing, 19 (6), pp. 41-56; Bengio, Y., Courville, A., Vincent, P., Representation learning: A review and new perspectives (2013) IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis & Machine Intelligence, 35 (8), pp. 1798-1828; Huang, C.J., Yang, D.X., Chuang, Y.T., Application of wrapper approach and composite classifier to the stock trend prediction (2008) Expert Systems with Applications, 34 (4), pp. 2870-2878; Tsai, C.F., Hsiao, Y.C., Combining multiple feature selection methods for stock prediction: Union, intersection, and multi-intersection approaches (2010) Decision Support Systems, 50 (1), pp. 258-269; Ni, L.-P., Ni, Z.-W., Gao, Y.-Z., Stock trend prediction based on fractal feature selection and support vector machine (2011) Expert Systems with Applications, 38 (5), pp. 5569-5576; Zhang, X., Hu, Y., Xie, K., Wang, S., Ngai, E., Liu, M., A causal feature selection algorithm for stock prediction modeling (2014) Neurocomputing, 142, pp. 48-59; Tao, Z., Qinke, P., Stock price prediction method based on cluster of trend vectors (2012) Proceedings of 2012 International Conference on Automatic Control and Artificial Intelligence, pp. 1930-1936; Patel, J., Shah, S., Thakkar, P., Kotecha, K., Predicting stock and stock price index movement using trend deterministic data preparation and machine learning techniques (2015) Expert Systems with Applications, 42 (1), pp. 259-268; Fischer, A., Igel, C., An introduction to restricted boltzmann machines (2012) Proceedings of 17th Iberoamerican Congress on Progress in Pattern Recognition, Image Analysis, Computer Vision, and Applications, pp. 14-36; Hinton, G.E., A practical guide to training restricted boltzmann machines (2012) Neural Networks: Tricks of the Trade, pp. 599-619. , 2nd ed., G.

Neural Networks, Decision Trees and Support Vector Machines are the most widely used approaches concerning regression-oriented applications, since they can generalize well in a number of different applications. In this work, we propose an efficient and effective regression technique based on the Finite Element Method (FEM) theory, hereinafter called Finite Element Machine for Regression (FEMaR). The proposed approach has only one parameter and it has a quadratic complexity for both training and classification phases when we use basis functions that obey some properties, as well as we show the proposed approach can obtain very competitive results when compared against some state-of-the-art regression techniques. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Data mining; Decision trees; Learning systems; Regression analysis; Weather forecasting; Basis functions; Quadratic complexity; Regression problem; Regression techniques; State of the art; Stock predictions; Finite element method",,,,,"Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq: 306166/2014-3

We do this by mining a popular Argentinian stock message board and empirically answering two questions. First, is there information in the online stock message board useful for predicting stock returns? Second, if useful information is found, is it novel or it is simply a different way of expressing information already available in the past behavior of stock prices? To address these questions, we build and validate a series of predictive models using state-of-the-art machine learning and topic discovery techniques. Running experiments in which the models are trained with different combinations of features extracted from the past behavior of stock prices, or mined from the online message boards. Evidence suggests that it is possible to extract predictive information from stock message boards. Furthermore, we find that adding this information improves the performance of classification systems trained solely on technical indicators. Our results suggest that information from online text data is complementary to the one available in the past evolution of stock prices. Additionally, we find that highly predictive features derived from the message board data seem to have an important and relevant semantic content. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Latent semantic analysis; Random forest; Ridge regression; Stock market; Text mining","Classification (of information); Costs; Data mining; Decision trees; Electronic trading; Financial markets; Forecasting; Investments; Learning systems; Regression analysis; Semantics; Classification system; Latent Semantic Analysis; Predictive information; Predictive models; Random forests; Ridge regression; Technical indicator; Text mining; Online systems",,,,,,,"Ginsberg, J., Mohebbi, M.H., Patel, R.S., Brammer, L., Smolinski, M.S., Brilliant, L., Detecting influenza epidemics using search engine query data (2009) Nature, 457 (7232), pp. 1012-1014; Eichstaedt, J.C., Schwartz, H.A., Kern, M.L., Park, G., Labarthe, D.R., Merchant, R.M., Jha, S., Seligman, M.E.P., Psychological language on twitter predicts county-level heart disease mortality (2015) Psychol.

The outcomes of the different machine learning algorithms are combined to form an ensemble to improve the prediction accuracy. In addition, two popular and widely used technical indicators are combined with the machine learning algorithms to further improve the prediction performance. To evaluate the proposed techniques, historical price and volume data over the past 15 months of three prominent stocks enlisted in Dhaka Stock Exchange are collected, which are used as training and test data for the algorithms to predict the 1-day, 1-week and 1-month-ahead prices of these stocks. The predictions are made both on training and test data sets and results are compared with other existing machine learning algorithms. The results indicate that the proposed ensemble approach as well as the combination of technical indicators with the machine learning algorithms can often provide better results, with reduced overall prediction error compared to many other existing prediction algorithms. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","Machine learning; Regression algorithms; Stock prediction; Technical indicators; Time series forecast","Artificial intelligence; Costs; Data mining; Electronic trading; Financial markets; Forecasting; Learning systems; Data mining algorithm; Prediction algorithms; Prediction performance; Regression algorithms; Stock predictions; Stock price prediction; Technical indicator; Time series forecasts; Learning algorithms",,,,,,,"Kim, K., Financial time series forecasting using support vector machines (2003) Neurocomputing, 55, pp. 307-319; Lu, C., Chang, C., Chen, C., Chiu, C., Lee, T., Stock index prediction: A comparison of MARS, BPN and SVR in an emerging market (2009) Proceedings of the IEEE IEEM, pp. 2343-2347; Lucas, K., Lai, C., James, N., Liu, K., Stock forecasting using support vector machine (2010) Proceedings of the Ninth International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics, pp. 1607-1614; Ince, H., Trafalis, T.B., (2004), pp. 2053-2058; Kannan, K.S., Sekar, P.S., Sathik, M.M., Arumugam, P., Financial stock market forecast using data mining techniques (2010) Proceedings of the International Multiconference of Engineers and Computer Scientists, pp. 555-559; Hu, Y., Pang, J., Financial crisis early warning based on support vector machine (2008) International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, pp. 2435-2440; Chen, K.-Y., Ho, C.-H., An improved support vector regression modeling for Taiwan Stock Exchange market weighted index forecasting (2005) The IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks Andbrain, pp. 1633-1638; Xue-Shen, S., Zhong-Ying, Q., Da-Ren, Y., Qing-Hua, H., Hui, Z., A novel feature selection approach using classification complexity for SVM of stock market trend prediction (2007) 14Th International Conference on Management Science, pp. 1654-1659; Debasish, B., Srimanta, P., Dipak, C.P., Support vector regression (2007) Neural Inf.

In this model, the strategy for each agent is a binary choice in the Minority Game and it can be modeled by a Binomial distribution with a Beta prior. The strategy of an agent can be learned given a sequence of historical choices by using Bayesian inference. Aggregated micro-level choices constitute the observable time series data in macro-level, therefore, this can be regarded as a machine learning model for time series prediction. To verify the effectiveness of the new model, we conduct a series of experiments on artificial data and real-world stock price data. Experimental results demonstrate the new proposed model has a better performance comparing to a genetic algorithm based decomposition model. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Bayesian inference; Collective behaviour; Stock prediction","Artificial intelligence; Bayesian networks; Bins; Genetic algorithms; Inference engines; Time series; Bayesian inference; Bayesian probabilistic models; Binomial distribution; Collective behaviour; Decomposition model; Machine learning models; Stock predictions; Time series prediction; Intelligent systems",,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 61401012","This work is funded by the National Science Foundation of China No. 61401012.","Arthur, W.B., Bounded rationality and inductive behavior (The El Farol problem (1994) Am.

The field of stock prediction has employed machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques to forecast the behavior of the financial market and to predict stock prices. Recently, social media has evolved to incorporate a massive amount and variety of textual data. The analysis of this information furthers the mining of public sentiment and opinions about real-time trends. In addition, the study of the inherently complex social media feeds promises new opportunities to discover empirical regularities to measure economic activity and analyze economic behavior at high frequency and in real-time. However, the noisy and short nature of social media feeds mask this information: unlike structured news content, social media content is characterized by the presence of metadata related to social media sites, (e.g., hashtags for Twitter) and the extensive usage of casual language, unstructured grammar, colloquial words, ad hoc multi-token nonstandard lexical items such as acronyms and abbreviations that need situational context to be interpreted and don't fit with traditional technical analysis simply based on forecasting models. Under those purposes and in order to meet the trading challenge in today's global market, technical analysis must be reconsidered. Before using any analysis model, data need to be preprocessed and regularities must be reviewed. So, the precision of the forecasting and prediction systems of the financial market and stock prices will be optimized and improved, also the accuracy of the data analysis models will be higher than state-of-art models. In this context, this study introduces the challenges of the noisy information overload from social media, gives a brief description of stock market prediction and its methodologies. Then, we discuss some of the current methods of stock prediction methodologies and emphasis the need of new improved ones which are more adapted to the context of noisy data. Finally, we present a new approach for the financial market forecasting and prediction which uses data preprocessing and normalization from noisy data in Twitter. The strong influence of the proposed data normalization model on the proposed approach's precision and accuracy can lead to a better results than traditional ones. © Medwell Journals, 2017.","Data mining; Natural language processing; Normalization; Predction; Social media; Stock market",,,,,,,,"Amelia, T.N., Causality test between exchange rate, inflation rate and stock price index in Southeast Asia (2016) J.

Prediction provides knowledgeable information regarding the current status of the stock price movement. Hence, it can be utilized in decision making for customers in finalizing whether to buy or sell the particular shares of a given stock. Stock market forecasters focus on developing a successful approach for forecast or predict index values of stock prices. Since in stock market, data are highly time variant and are normally in a nonlinear pattern, pre predicting the future price of a stock is highly challenging. From the evolution of machine learning, researchers from this area are busy to solve this problem effectively. Many different techniques are used to build predicting system. Here we describe the different state of the art techniques used for stock forecasting and compare them with respect to their pros and cons. Many methods like technical analysis, fundamental analysis, timeseries analysis etc are used to predict the price but none of these are proved as a consistently acceptable. Neural Network is the best technique till time to predict stock prices especially when some de-noising schemes are applied to a neural network. Artificial Neural Network (ANN), a field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), is a popular way to identify unknown and hidden patterns in data which is suitable for share market prediction. The past data of the selected stock will be used for building and training the models. The results from the model will be used for comparison with the real data to ascertain the accuracy of the model. In this approach, we use back propagation algorithm for training phase and multilayer feed forward network as a network model for predicting the price of a share. © 2017 AMSE Press.

Popular predicting models, such as logistic regression, are quite effective in predicting the trend of a stock. A robust classifier can maximize the profit of stock purchase while keep the risk low. In this paper, we present a theoretical and empirical framework to apply L2-regularized logistic regression to predict the stock market. Firstly, we select ten factors that may influence the stock trend, and use logistics regression to model the relationship of these factors and the quality of stocks. Instead of directly using logistic regression on the original data, we firstly used NMF to unsupervised learn part-based representations of the data, and then a classifier is trained on those representations. Our experimental results suggest that logistic regression with part-based representation of data is a powerful predictive tool for stock predictions in the financial market. © 2015 IEEE.","logistic regression; nonnegative matrix factorization; projected gradient method; stock classification","Commerce; Factorization; Financial markets; Forecasting; Gradient methods; Machine learning; Matrix algebra; Logistic regressions; Logistics regressions; Market prediction; Nonnegative matrix factorization; Part-based representation; Predicting models; Projected gradient methods; Stock classification; Regression analysis",,,,,,,"Lee, D.D., Sebastian Seung, H., Learning the parts of objects by non-negative matrix factorization (1999) Nature, 401, pp. 788-791; Lee, D.D., Sebastian Seung, H., Algorithms for nonnegative matrix factorization (2001) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 13, pp. 556-562. , MIT Press; Gonzales, E.F., Zhang, Y., Accelerating the Lee-Seung Algorithm for Non-negative Matrix Factorization, , Technical report.

Generally, investors use two statistical techniques for making a decision, which are the fundamental analysis and the technical analysis. Recently, machine learning models which are a part of artificial intelligence, has been applied to enhance investors for investment. A number of machine learning models have been investigated for stock prediction such as Genetic Algorithms (GAs), Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Neural Network (NN). In this paper, several multiclass classification techniques using neural networks are investigated. The multi-binary classification experiments using One-Against-One (OAO) and One-Against-All (OAA) techniques are tested and they are compared with the traditional neural network. Furthermore, an alternative data preparation and a data selection process are proposed. The experimental results show that the multi-binary classification using OAA technique outperforms other techniques. It can provide the return on investment greater than the traditional analysis techniques. © 2016 IEEE.","data mining; financial prediction model; multiclass classification; neural network","Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Commerce; Data mining; Decision support systems; Electronic trading; Finance; Financial markets; Genetic algorithms; Learning systems; Neural networks; Profitability; Support vector machines; Binary classification; Financial prediction; Fundamental analysis; Genetic algorithm (GAs); Machine learning models; Multi-class classification; Statistical techniques; Support vector machine (SVMs); Investments",,,,,,,"Agrawal, J.G., Chourasia, D.V.S., Mittra, D.A.K., State-of - The-art in stock prediction techniques (2013) International Journal of Advanced Research in Electrical, Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering, 2, pp. 1360-1366; Wind, D.K., (2014) Concepts in Predictive Machine Learning, pp. 1-129. , Technical University of Denmark; Siew, H.L., Nordin, M.J., Regression technique for the prediction of stock price trend (2012) Statistics in Science, Business, and Engineering (ICSSBE), pp. 1-5. , Langkawi Universiti Kuala Lumpur; Bonde, G., Khaled, R., Stock Price Prediction Using Genetic Algorithms and Evolution Strategies, , Artificial Intelligence Athens University of Groria; Xu, Y., Li, Z., Luo, L., A study on feature selection for the trend prediction of stock trading price (2013) Computational and Information Sciences (ICCIS), pp. 579-582. , Shiyang Xiamen University; Mingtao, W., Yong, Y., The research on stock price forecast model based on data mining of BP neural network (2012) Intelligent System Design and Engineering Application (ISDEA) 2013 Third International Conference Hong Kong, pp. 1526-1529; Khan, A.U., Gour, B., Stock market trends prediction using neural network based hybrid model (2013) Computer Science Engineering and Information Technology Research (IJCSEITR), 3, pp. 11-18; Banik, S., Khan, A.F.M.K., Anwer, M., Dhaka stock market timing decisions by hybrid machine learning technique (2012) ICCIT, 15th International Conference Chittagong Independent University, pp. 384-389; Klassen, M., Investigation of some technical indexes in stock forecasting using neural networks (2005) Computer Science California Lutheran Oaks; Khan, S.S., Madden, M.G., A survey of recent trends in one class classification Engineering and Informatics Ireland, , National University of Ireland Galway; Jeatrakul, P., (2012) Enhancing Classification Performance over Noise and Imbalanced Data Problems, , Murdoch University; Ou, G., Murphey, Y.L., Feldkamp, L., Multiclass pattern classification using neural networks Proceedings of the 17th International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR'04); Boonpeng, S., Jeatrakul, P., Enhance the performance of neural networks for stock market prediction: An analytical study (2014) Digital Information Management (ICDIM) 2014 Ninth International Conference on, pp. 1-6. , Phitsanulok, Thailand; Person, J.L., (2002) Swing Trading Using Candlestick Charting with Pivot Point Analysis; (2001) Data Preprocessing, , C.

There are several algorithms based on machine learning and data mining methods that exhibit promising results. Relevant work in the literature seems to focus on the improvement of existing or new methods to increase forecasting accuracy and speed. Comparative analyses between techniques is limited and often restricted to comparing just two similar techniques. Across such studies it is difficult to find common ground with respect to the implementation environments, the data sources used for the analysis and the sizes and ranges of the training data sets. Six the most commonly used stock prediction algorithms are implemented and compared over the same set of data. The implemented techniques are also validated against other data to compare their accuracy of prediction. The source code and associated libraries that visualize the results of easy comparison constitute an open source infrastructure available for experimentation, reproducibility of results and addition of other algorithms.

More importantly, as the modern stock markets react very sensitively to information for their stock prices, it is very important to predict the prices for investors. For that, this study shall utilize opinion mining and mechanical learning, which are widely used to analyze the meaning of information in systematic ways on analyzing data from news and Twitter to suggest a system that predicts stock prices. The stock price prediction system consists of a data collector, vocabulary analyzer, sentiment analyzer and stock price predictor. The stock price predicting steps consist of collecting contents of news and Twitter, extracting vocabularies by using morpheme analysis, executing sentiment analysis then predicting stock prices via mechanical learning. In order to evaluate the usefulness of the suggested method, we used the stock data for the last whole year on 7 companies in the bio industry that are most sensitive to information for the tests, and the accuracy of the results showed above 80%. The results of this study can be regarded as one of the methods to effectively predict stock prices of companies from various backgrounds in this modern information era that changes dramatically every moment. © 2016 SERSC.","Data mining; Machine learning; Opinion mining; Stock price prediction",,,,,,,,"Kim, M.-J., Kim, H.-B., Kang, D.-K., Optimizing SVM Ensembles Using Genetic Algorithms in Bankruptcy Prediction (2010) Journal of information and communication convergence engineering, 8 (4), pp. 370-376; Park, J.M., Gene Algorithm of Crowd System of Data Mining (2012) Journal of information and communication convergence engineering, 10 (1), pp. 40-44; Binali, H., Potdar, V., Wu, C., A state of the art opinion mining and its application domains.

An intelligent stock prediction model would thus be desirable. So, this paper aims at surveying recent literature in the area of Neural Network, Hidden Markov Model and Support Vector Machine used to predict the stock market fluctuation. Neural networks and SVM are identified to be the leading machine learning techniques in stock market prediction area. Also, a model for predicting stock market using HMM is presented. Traditional techniques lack in covering stock price fluctuations and so new approaches have been developed for analysis of stock price variations. Markov Model is one such recent approach promising better results. In this paper a predicting method using Hidden Markov Model is proposed to provide better accuracy and a comparison of the existing techniques is also done. © 2014 IEEE.","Hidden Markov Model; Mean Absolute Percentage Error; Mean Squared Error; Neural networks; Stock market prediction; Support Vector Machine","Artificial intelligence; Commerce; Finance; Financial markets; Forecasting; Hidden Markov models; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Markov processes; Mean square error; Neural networks; Support vector machines; Investment schemes; Machine learning techniques; Mean absolute percentage error; Mean squared error; Stock market prediction; Stock predictions; Stock price fluctuation; Traditional techniques; Investments",,,,,,,"Gupta, A., Dhingra, B., Stock market prediction using hidden markov models (2012) IEEE; Abhishek, K., Khairwa, A., Pratap, T., Prakash, S., A stock market prediction model using artificial neural network (2012) ICCCNT12, , 26 th 28th July, Coimbatore, India; Luo, F., Wu, J., Yan, K., A novel nonlinear combination model based on support vector machine for stock market prediction (2010) Proc. of the 8 Th World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation, , July 6-9, Jinan, China.

However, this hypothesis has been featured by several empirical experiential studies and a number of researchers have efficiently applied machine learning techniques to forecast stock market. This paper studied stock prediction for the use of investors. It is always true that investors typically obtain loss because of uncertain investment purposes and unsighted assets. This paper proposes a rough set model, a neural network model, and a hybrid neural network and rough set model to find optimal buy and sell of a share on Dhaka stock exchange. Investigational findings demonstrate that our proposed hybrid model has higher precision than the single rough set model and the neural network model.

If someone has robust forecasting tools, then he/she will increase the return on investment and can get rich easily and quickly. Because there are a lot of factors that can influence the stock market, the stock forecasting problem has always been very complicated. Support Vector Regression is a tool from machine learning that can build a regression model on the historical time series data in the purpose of predicting the future trend of the stock price.

Stock prices are influenced by many factors such as oil prices, exchange rates, money interest rates, stock price indexes in other countries, and economic situations. Although these factors affect the stock price independently, they have an influence on the stock price through a complex interrelation, i.e.; a network structure between these factors. In the stock prediction, the conventional methods represent limitations in reflecting the interrelation and complexity in these factors. In this paper, a stock prediction method using a semi-supervised learning (SSL) algorithm is proposed to circumvent such limitations. The SSL algorithm is a method that can implement a network consisting of nodes of the factors and edges of similarities between them. Through the network structure, the SSL algorithm is able to reflect the reciprocal and cyclic influences among the factors to prediction. The proposed model is applied to the stock price prediction from January 2007 to August 2008, using the global economic index and the stock prices of 200 individual companies listed to the KOSPI200. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Machine learning; Semi-supervised learning (SSL); Stock price prediction","Conventional methods; Economic factors; Economic situation; Global economics; Network structures; Semi-supervised learning (SSL); Stock predictions; Stock price prediction; Algorithms; Forecasting; Learning systems; Supervised learning; Complex networks",,,,,"2010-0007804/2012-0000994","The authors would like to gratefully acknowledge support from Post Brain Korea 21 and the research Grant from National Research Foundation of the Korean Government ( 2010-0007804/2012-0000994 ).","Amilon, H., GARCH estimation and discrete stock prices: An application to low-priced Australian stocks (2003) Econ.

However, this theory has been faced by many empirical studies and a number of researchers have successfully applied machine learning approaches to predict stock market. The problem studied here is about stock prediction for the use of investors. It is true investors usually get loss because of unclear investment objective and blind investment. This paper proposes to investigate the rough set model, the artificial neural network model and the hybrid artificial neural network model and the rough set model for determining the optimal buy and sell of a share on a Dhaka stock exchange. Confusion matrix is used to evaluate the performance of the observed and predicted classes for selected models. Our experimental result shows that the proposed hybrid model has higher accuracy than the single rough set model and the artificial neural network model. We believe this paper will be useful to stock investors to determine the optimal buy and sell time on Dhaka Stock Exchange. © 2012 IEEE.","Confusion matrix; Hybrid machine learning; Neural network; Rough set; Stock market prediction; Technical indicators","Applied machine learning; Artificial neural network models; Confusion matrices; Hybrid artificial neural network; Hybrid machine learning; Stock market prediction; Stock market timings; Technical indicator; Commerce; Forecasting; Image resolution; Information technology; Learning systems; Neural networks; Optimization; Rough set theory; Investments",,,,,,,"Yao, J., Herbert, J.P., Financial time-series analysis with rough sets (2009) Applied Soft Computing, pp. 1000-1007; Shen, L., Loh, H.T., Applying rough sets to market timing decisions (2004) Decision Support Systems, pp. 583-597; Shamsuddin, S.M., Jaaman, S.H., Darus, M., Neuro-rough trading rules for mining Kuala Lumpur composite index (2009) European Journal of Scientific Research, pp. 278-286; Jaaman, S.H., Shamsuddin, S.M., Yusob, B., Ismail, M., A predictive model construction applying rough set methodology for Malaysian stock market returns (2009) International Research Journal of Finance and Economics, pp. 211-218; Tsai, C.F., Wang, S.P., Stock price forecasting by hybrid machine learning techniques (2009) Proceedings of the International MultiConference of Engineers and Computer Scientists, , Hongkong; Tay, F.E.H., Shen, L., Economic and financial prediction using rough sets model (2002) European Journal of Operational Research, pp. 643-661; Pawlak, Z., Rough sets (1982) International Journal of Computer and Information Science, pp. 341-356; Culloch, W.S., Pitts, W., A logical calculus of the ideas immanent in nervous activity (1943) B.

In this paper, we propose a novel stock prediction method based on a multilayer feedforward neural network. To reduce the effect of noisy trends, it employs the piecewise linear representation which transforms the original time series of the stock price and the trading volume into a set of time segments. The transformed information is served as the input variables in the neural network for prediction. We tested the proposed method annually from 2001 to 2009. It showed a good performance of about 55% accuracy on average in predicting the price direction. It was also successful in making more profit than the buy-and-hold trading strategy. © 2011 IEEE.","artificial neural network; Piecewise linear representation; stock prediction; trading strategies","Artificial Neural Network; Input variables; Multilayer feedforward neural networks; Piecewise linear representation; Stock market; Stock predictions; Stock price; Stock price prediction; Time segments; Trading strategies; Trading volumes; Commerce; Feedforward neural networks; Hybrid systems; Piecewise linear techniques; Profitability; Time series; Forecasting",,,,,,,"Padhiary, P.K., Mishra, A.P., Development of improv ed artif icial neural network mo del for stocik market prediction (2011) Pra., Inter. jour.

In this paper, we propose an algorithm to discover self-correlation of stock price in virtue of the notion of time series motifs, by viewing stock price sequences as time series. Generally, time series motif is a pattern appearing frequently in a time sequence, useful to forecast the stock temporal tendencies and prices as a reliable part in time series. In the proposed approach, we firstly search for one part of time series motifs using ordinal comparison and k-NN clustering algorithm, and then attempt to discover the correlation between motifs and subsequences connected behind them. Experimental results demonstrate the positive contribution of time series motifs, the acceptable prediction accuracy, and priority of our algorithm. © 2009 IEEE.","Self-correlation; Stock prediction; Time series motifs","Machine-learning; ON time; Prediction accuracy; Self-correlation; Stock prediction; Stock price; Temporal prediction; Tendency prediction; Time sequences; Time series motifs; Control theory; Cybernetics; Robot learning; Time series; Clustering algorithms",,,,,,,"Tǐno, P., Schittenkopf, C., Dorffner, G., Financial volatility trading using recurrent neural networks (2001) IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks, 12, pp. 865-874; Ke, J., Liu, X., Empirical Analysis of Optimal Hidden Neurons in Neural Network Modeling for Stock Prediction (2008) IEEE Pacific-Asia Workshop on Computational Intelligence and Industrial Application, pp. 828-832; Keun Kwon, P., Soon Choi, S., Ro Moon, P., (2005) Stock prediction based on financial correlation, Genetic and evolutionary computation, pp. 2061-2066. , Washington DC, USA; Wang, Y.F., Predicting stock price using fuzzy gray. prediction system (2002) Expert Systems with Applications, 22 (1), pp. 33-38; Chae, Y.M., Ho, S.H., Cho, K.W., Lee, D.H., Ji, S.H., Data mining approach to policy analysis in a health insurance domain (2001) International Journal of Medical Informatics, 62 (2), pp. 103-111; Huiyi Tan, H.J.C., Li, Y., (2008) Frequent Patterns of Investment Behaviors in Shanghai Stock Market, Computer Science and Software Engineering, pp. 325-328. , Dec; White, H., Economic prediction using neural networks: The case of IBM daily stock returns (1988) IEEE Conference on Neural Networks, pp. 451-458; Tsang, E.P.K., Li, J., Butler, J.M., EDDIE beats the bookies (1998) International Journal of Software, Practice and Experience, 28 (10), pp. 1033-1043; Chiu, E.

We approach this line of research using textual representation and statistical machine learning methods on financial news articles partitioned by similar industry and sector groupings. Through our research, we discovered that stocks partitioned by Sectors were most predictable in measures of Closeness, Mean Squared Error (MSE) score of 0.1954, predicted Directional Accuracy of 71.18% and a Simulated Trading return of 8.50% (compared to 5.62% for the S&P 500 index). In direct comparisons to existing market experts and quantitative mutual funds, our system's trading return of 8.50% outperformed well-known trading experts. Our system also performed well against the top 10 quantitative mutual funds of 2005, where our system would have placed fifth. When comparing AZFinText against only those quantitative funds that monitor the same securities, AZFinText had a 2% higher return than the best performing quant fund. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Numerous researchers tried to predict the immediate future stock prices or indices based on technical indices with various mathematical models and machine learning techniques such as artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector machines (SVM) and ARIMA models. Although some researches in the literature exhibit satisfactory prediction achievement when the average percentage error and root mean square error are used as the performance metrics, the prediction accuracy of whether stock market goes or down is seldom analyzed. This paper employs wrapper approach to select the optimal feature subset from original feature set composed of 23 technical indices and then uses voting scheme that combines different classification algorithms to predict the trend in Korea and Taiwan stock markets. Experimental result shows that wrapper approach can achieve better performance than the commonly used feature filters, such as χ2-Statistic, Information gain, ReliefF, Symmetrical uncertainty and CFS. Moreover, the proposed voting scheme outperforms single classifier such as SVM, kth nearest neighbor, back-propagation neural network, decision tree, and logistic regression. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
